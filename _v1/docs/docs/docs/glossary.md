| context / context scope | Set of `has` variables bound to a node, edge, or walker object. These variables remain persistent until the object is deleted (destroyed).                                                          |
| has variable            | A variable that persists throughout multiple executions of a codeblock.                                                                                                                             |
| local variable          | A variable that exists only during a single execution of a codeblock.                                                                                                                               |
| sentinel                | A collection of archetypes that are visible to each other.                                                                                                                                          |
| architype               | A blueprint or a template for creating objects (instances) of nodes, edges, walkers, struct types (or graphs, which are special walkers that construct a pattern of interconnected nodes and edges) |
