## Set
Sets are a type of data structure used to store multiple items in one variable. Along with List, Tuple, and Dictionary, sets are one of Python's four built-in data types for handling collections. A set is unique in that it is unordered, unchangeable, and does not use indexing.

**Code Example**
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_sets/jac_sets_intro/jac_sets_intro.jac"
    ```

## Set Items
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

## Unordered
Unordered means that the items in a set do not follow a specific order. Each time you use a set, its items may appear in a different order, and they cannot be accessed using an index or key.

## Unchangeable
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

## Duplicates Not Allowed
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
