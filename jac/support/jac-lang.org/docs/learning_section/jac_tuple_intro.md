Tuples store multiple items in one variable.They are ordered, unchangeable, and use round brackets.

**Code Example**
=== "Jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_tuple/jac_tuple_intro/jac_tuple_intro.jac"
    ```

## Tuple Items
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

## Ordered
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

## Unchangeable
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

## Allow Duplicates
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

**Code Example**
=== "Jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_tuple/jac_tuple_intro/jac_tuple_duplicates.jac"
    ```

## Tuple Length
To determine how many items a tuple has, use the **len()** function:

**Code Example**
=== "Jac"
    ```jac linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_tuple/jac_tuple_intro/jac_tuple_length.jac"
    ```
