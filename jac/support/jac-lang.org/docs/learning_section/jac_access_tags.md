# Access Tags in Jac

In Jac, **Access Tags** control the visibility and accessibility of various elements like,

- architypes
- attributes (`has`)
- abilities (`can`)
- enumerations (`enum`)
- global variables (`glob`)

By using these access tags, we can ensure proper encapsulation and prevent unintended access.


## Types of Access Tags

Jac provides three main access levels:

| Access Tag | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `pub`   | **(Public)** - Accessible from anywhere   |
| `protect`    | **(Protected)** - Accessible within the same scope and derived elements   |
| `priv`    | **(Private)** - Accessible only within the same scope   |

We'll explore each access tag in the following examples.

## Access Tags for Global Variables

Global variables in Jac can be restricted using access tags.

### Public Global Variables (`pub`)

If a global variable is marked with the `pub` access tag, it can be accessed anywhereâ€”in the **same module** or in any module that **imports** it.

**Code Example:**

#### Defining a Public Global Variable

Let's say we define a global variable in one file:

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:6:7"
```

- Since the global variable `num1` is marked with the `pub` access tag, it can be accessed from anywhere in the program, both within the same file or in other files that import `file1.jac`.


#### Accessing the Public Global Variable

Now, let's see how we can access the `num1` variable in the **same module** and from **other modules**.

**Example 1: Accessing Within the Same Module**

- You can access the `num1` global variable directly in the same module, like so:

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:6:11"
```


**Example 2: Accessing from Another File**

- To access the global variable `num1` from another file, you simply need to **import** the module where num1 is defined.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:13:18"
```


### Private Global Variables (`priv`)

When a global variable is marked with the `priv` tag, it becomes **private** to the module where it is defined. This means it cannot be accessed from other modules, even if those modules import the file where the variable is defined.

**Code Example:**

#### Defining a Private Global Variable

Let's say you define a global variable in one file:

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:22:23"
```

- Since the global variable `num2` is marked with the `priv` access tag, it can **only be accessed** in `file1.jac` and **not** in any other files that import `file1.jac`.

#### Accessing the Private Global Variable

**Example 1: Accessing Within the Same Module**

- You can access the `num2` global variable directly in the same module, like so:

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:22:27"
```


**Example 2: Accessing from Another File**

- If you try to access the `num2` global variable from a different file, it will not work because `num2` is private to `file1.jac`.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:29:34"
```


## Access Tags for Architypes

In Jac, architypes define with different access levels. The `:pub` (public), `:priv` (private), and `:protect` (protected) tags determine how these architypes can be accessed from different scopes.


### Public Architypes

An architype marked as `:pub` is accessible **from anywhere** in the program.

Other objects, entry functions, and external modules can **freely** reference and instantiate.

**Code Example**

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:55:62"
```


### Private Architypes

If an Architype is marked as `:priv`, it cannot be accessed from outside its relavant scope.

**Code Example**

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:66:73"
```

- In the above example `InnerPrivObj` Architype has been defined inside the Architype `SomeObj`. So, we can't create instances of `InnerPrivObj` outside the `SomeObj`'s scope.



## Access Tags for Attributes

In Jac, **attributes** can have different access levels to control how they are used and modified. These access levels help in **encapsulation** and **data security**.

### Public Attributes

A **public** attribute can be accessed and modified **from anywhere**.

**Code Example**

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:85:93"
```

### Private Attributes

Let's say a **private** attribute is defined inside an Architype.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:96:98"
```

That **private** attribute **can be accessed or Modified** inside the Architype.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:100:110"
```

A **private** attribute **cannot be accessed or modified** outside the object. It is used to store internal data that should not be directly modified.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:116:120"
```

## Access Tags for Abilities

In Jac, **abilities** can have different access levels. These access levels define where an ability can be **called from**.

### Public Abilities

A **public** ability can be called from **anywhere** outside the object.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:125:134"
```

### Private Abilities

Let's say a **private** ability is defined inside an Architype.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:137:141"
```

That **private** ability **can be called** inside the Architype's scope.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:143:150"
```

A **private** ability **cannot be called** outside the Architype's scope.

```jac linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/learning_section/jac_access_tag.jac:152:160"
```
