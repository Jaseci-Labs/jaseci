# **Overview of Jaseci**

## **What is Jaseci?**

**Jaseci** is an **open-source** comprehensive technology **stack**. It integrates tools and frameworks that work together to simplify complex software development. It’s not just a programming tool but an **ecosystem** aimed at reducing complexity in modern **AI-powered** and **cloud-native** applications.

### **Jaseci Ecosystem**
This is a collection of libraries and frameworks in the Jaseci Ecosystem.

1. **Jac Lang**:
      - The Jac programming language, a drop-in replacement for and supersets Python.

2. **MTLLM (Meaning Type LLM)**:
      - Integrates LLM into your existing application with minimal effort.

3. **Jac Cloud**:
      - The cloud-native library for Jac programs. jac-cloud automatically converts your local application to a production-ready server stack.

4. **Jac Splice Orc (JAC Cloud Orchestrator)**:
      - Dynamically turns Python modules into Kubernetes-deployed gRPC microservices, simplifying remote execution and cloud scalability by handling infrastructure management automatically.

5. **Jac Streamlit**
      - Quickly build UI with Jac and Streamlit.
