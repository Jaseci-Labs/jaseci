<h1 style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Welcome to Jac</h1>

**Jac** combines the power and flexibility of Python's ecosystem and 'pythonic' coding style with a unique 'jactastic' approach to programming. It draws inspiration from a variety of programming languages to improve upon Python to create an engaging, productive, and intuitive coding experience, giving the coder all of python's power, plus superpowers. Additionally, Jac introduces a keystone innovation that may prove to be a monumental advancement in programming languages called the **Data Spatial Programming Model**.

Just as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought a higher level of abstraction to C and Fortran's functions offered a new way to manage assembly code, Jac introduces Data Spatial Programming constructs expanding on the concept of OOP. This new model is a higher-level abstraction that lets programmers rethink how they interact with data structures, and enable new ways of thinking and being productive.

That being said, Jac was meticulously designed to provide a seamless gradient of expressiveness allowing coders to code in a familiar pythonic style, while using as much or as little data spatial semantics as they'd like.

Join us on this exciting journey. Let's make code art with Jac.
