# Types and Type Hinting

## Primitive Types
Just say that all the python primitive types are supported in jac (int, float, list, dict, etc.)
Give one simple code examples that just uses int, float, list, dict, etc.

## Custom Types
Describe how to create custom type with `obj`. You can say this is similiar to python dataclass. but it works similar as python class.
Explain you should use has + post init. Mention that we do not recommend to use init (but you can if you want to).
Give one simple example of an obj with has and post init.

## Type Hinting and Annotation
Describe jaclang enforces type hinting for abilities parameters, has variables. But we don't enforce for return type.
We just need to cover the whole spec.
