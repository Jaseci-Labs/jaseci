# webhook
- webhook walker is similar to normal authenticated walker however, normal authenticated walker is associated to a user while webhook is directly to root.
- webhook api keys are manage by user
- supports different HTTP components as API key holder
  - header (default):
  - query
  - path
  - body
- name of the api-key can be change to any string (default: `X-API-KEY`)

## CREATE WEBHOOK
```python
walker webhook {
    can enter1 with `root entry {
        report here;
    }

    class __specs__ {
        has webhook: dict = {
            "type": "header | query | path | body", # optional: defaults to header
            "name": "any string" # optional: defaults to X-API-KEY
        };
    }
}
