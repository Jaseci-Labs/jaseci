# <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Jac in a Flash</span>

Here we demonstrate an example where the ```guess_game.py``` python program, which implements a guess the number game, is converted to jac-lang, which is shown in ```guess_game1.jac```. This Transformation has a one-to-one mapping with the python program.

However, as the iterations progress in the game version you me discover fascinating changes which will show you the way of jac. The final implementation ins ```guess_game5.jac``` is the ultimate realization of jac using the data spatial architecture.

Happy code deconstructing!
