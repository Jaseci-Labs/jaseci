# Implementation Steps

This document provides a roadmap for implementing the type checking system in phases.

## Phase 1: Core Type System

1. Implement the core type classes:
   - Basic `Type` class and subclasses
   - `TypeRegistry` for type storage and lookup
   - Support for subtyping relationships
   - Support for primitive types

2. Integrate with Jac's AST:
   - Add type information to expression nodes
   - Set up symbol table integration
   - Create serialization/deserialization for types

## Phase 2: Type Inference Engine

1. Implement constraint-based inference:
   - `InferenceContext` for tracking type assignments
   - Type constraints and constraint solving
   - Core inference algorithms

2. Add type inference rules:
   - Literal type inference
   - Binary operation inference
   - Function call and attribute access inference
   - Control flow-based inference

## Phase 3: Type Checking Pipeline

1. Create the compiler passes:
   - `TypeRegistryBuildPass` for collecting types
   - `TypeInferencePass` for assigning types
   - `TypeCheckPass` for validating compatibility

2. Integrate with the existing compiler infrastructure:
   - Update the CompilerMode enum
   - Modify scheduling in JacProgram
   - Add configuration options

## Phase 4: Error Reporting System

1. Design the diagnostic model:
   - `TypeDiagnostic` with severity, message, and location
   - Related information for context
   - Suggestions for fixing issues

2. Implement error reporters:
   - Type compatibility error reporting
   - Symbol resolution error reporting
   - Special case handlers for common mistakes

## Phase 5: Jac-Specific Features

1. Add support for Jac-specific types:
   - Node and edge architypes
   - Graph traversal operations
   - Walker types

2. Implement special constructors:
   - Connect operator typing
   - Visit statement analysis
   - Special ability features

## Phase 6: External Integration

1. Build the Language Server Protocol implementation:
   - Document synchronization
   - Error reporting
   - Hover and completion support

2. Create command-line interface:
   - File and directory scanning
   - Configuration options
   - Output formatting

3. Expose Python API:
   - Programmatic access to type checking
   - Support for editor integrations
   - Test infrastructure

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Verify type compatibility rules
   - Check inference logic

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test compiler pass integration
   - Verify pipeline correctness
   - Check error reporting accuracy

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Test with real Jac programs
   - Verify IDE integration
   - Benchmark performance

## Milestones

| Milestone | Description | Estimated Time |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Core type system implementation | 2 weeks |
| 2 | Basic type inference for literals and expressions | 2 weeks |
| 3 | Full type checking pipeline integration | 3 weeks |
| 4 | Error reporting and suggestions | 2 weeks |
| 5 | Jac-specific language feature support | 3 weeks |
| 6 | External integration (LSP, CLI, API) | 3 weeks |
| 7 | Testing and refinement | 2 weeks |

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Performance** - Type checking can be computationally expensive, especially for larger codebases. We'll need to implement:
   - Incremental analysis
   - Caching of results
   - Parallel processing where possible

2. **Integration** - The type checker needs to work seamlessly with the existing compiler infrastructure without disrupting current functionality.

3. **Usability** - Error messages must be clear and actionable to be useful for developers.

4. **Special Features** - Jac-specific language constructs require special handling in the type system.

## Dependencies

The implementation depends on:
- Existing compiler pass system
- AST structure and symbol tables
- Parsing infrastructure

## Success Criteria

The type checking system will be considered successful when it:
1. Accurately detects type errors in Jac programs
2. Provides clear and actionable error messages
3. Integrates seamlessly with IDEs and editors
4. Performs efficiently on large codebases
5. Supports all Jac-specific language features
