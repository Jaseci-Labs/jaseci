In Jac, an archetype functions similarly to classes in traditional object-oriented programming languages. It allows the definition of data structures with both state and behavior encapsulated within. The provided Jac code snippet demonstrates the definition and usage of an archetype named `Car`.

The `Car` archetype includes three instance variables (`make`, `model`, and `year`) and one class variable (`wheels`). Instance variables are defined using the `has` keyword and can have specific types (`str` for strings and `int` for integers). The `static` keyword precedes the class variable definition, indicating that `wheels` is shared across all instances of `Car`.

Types are annotated directly after the variable name (required for all `has` variables) and are followed by a colon. For instance, `make: str` declares a variable `make` of type `string`.

The `Car` archetype also defines two methods, `display_car_info` as an instance method and `get_wheels` as a static method. Methods are introduced with the `can` keyword. The instance method `display_car_info` uses a formatted string to print car information, accessing instance variables with the `self` reference. The static method `get_wheels` returns the value of the static variable `wheels`.

An instance of `Car` is created using the archetype name as a constructor, passing in values for `make`, `model`, and `year`. This instance is assigned to the variable `car`.

Instance methods are invoked using the dot notation on the instance (`car.display_car_info()`), and static methods are called directly on the archetype (`Car.get_wheels()`).

The `entry` block serves as the entry point of the program, where a `Car` instance is created, and its methods are invoked to display the car's information and the number of wheels.
