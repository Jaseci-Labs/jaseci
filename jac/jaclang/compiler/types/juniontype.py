Defines `JUnionType`, which represents a union of multiple possible types

This is useful for modeling nullable values, overloads, structural flexibility,

    Represents a union of multiple possible types in the Jac type system.

    A value of this type may be one of several constituent types.
    Unions are automatically flattened and deduplicated upon creation.

    Attributes:
        options (list[JType]): The list of possible types (flattened and unique).

    Behavior:
        - Nested unions are flattened automatically.
        - Redundant types are eliminated (by object identity).
        - Assignability allows for any direction between a union and its members.
        - Member access is limited to common members across all union branches.
