## Goal of this test is to list all asigngment statement variantions

with entry {
    let x = 5.7;
    let a = b = c = x;
    x0: int = 5.5;
    x1: bool = 0;
    a = False;
    # data: list = [];
    x1 += 1;
    x1 -= 3;
    fn = 3;
    fn() = 4;
    x1: float = 7.7;
}

can fn(a: int) {
    return False;
}
