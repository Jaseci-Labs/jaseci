<h1 style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Welcome to Jac</h1>

**Jac** combines the power and flexibility of Python's ecosystem and 'pythonic' coding style with a unique 'jactastic' approach to programming. It draws inspiration from a variety of programming languages to improve upon Python to create an engaging, productive, and intuitive coding experience, giving the coder all of python's power, plus superpowers. Additionally, Jac introduces a keystone innovation that may prove to be a monumental advancement in programming languages called the **Data Spatial Programming Model**.

Just as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought a higher level of abstraction to C and Fortran's functions offered a new way to manage assembly code, Jac introduces Data Spatial Programming constructs expanding on the concept of OOP. This new model is a higher-level abstraction that lets programmers rethink how they interact with data structures, and enable new ways of thinking and being productive.

That being said, Jac was meticulously designed to provide a seamless gradient of expressiveness allowing coders to code in a familiar pythonic style, while using as much or as little data spatial semantics as they'd like.


## <span style="color: orange;">A Love Letter to Python, and Beyond</span>
Jac's design encapsulates a love for the world of programming, computers, and code. It captures the spirit of what makes coding joyful while expanding upon the foundation laid by the beloved language - Python. At its core, Jac is a love letter to Python and modern coding. It inherits the clean syntax, flexibility, and broad applicability that makes Python one of the most popular programming languages in the world while being designed to give us coders new (and old) superpowers.

The goal of Jac is to serve as a home language for a coders lifestyle. Jac is built for us, folks who love python, see coding as beauty, and are serious hackers aiming to launch everything they do to the world. It is the language that I've always wanted and one that I believe you will enjoy too. We are looking forward to seeing what you will create with Jac, and how you will add to its evolving story.

Join us on this exciting journey. Let's make code art with Jac.
