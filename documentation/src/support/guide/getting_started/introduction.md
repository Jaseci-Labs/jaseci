# Jaseci Overview

## What is Jaseci?

Jaseci is an end-to-end open-source and Open Computational Model, Technology Stack, and Methodology for bleeding edge AI. It enables developers to rapidly build robust products with sophisticated AI capabilities at scale.

## Why Jaseci?

* Jaseci brings application development, AI Models and code infrastructure together under a single solution stack. 
* Jaseci comes with pre-built, pre-trained AI models for most AI Related tasks out of the box.
* Using the JAC Programming language you are able to leverage all the goodness that Jaseci has to offer such as wielding powerful AI models and exposing complex business logic via automatically generated APIs.
* The integrated Jaseci Diffuse Runtime System handles the orchestration, configuration and optimization of the full cloud compute stack and inter-machine resources such as container formation, scaling and optimization. In essence it provides all the technology needed to develop an AI application in one platform.
* Jaseci allows you to remove data management from your workflow with a baked-in data persistence layer.
* Jaseci was desgined to reduce development team specializations. You'll only need a single Jaseci Engineer to do the work of DevOps Engineers, Frontend and Backend engineers and AI engineers.
* With Jaseci's graph-based representation of data and operations, you'll be able to visualize your solutions and navigate complexity with ease.
* Develop rapidly with Jaseci's level of abstraction and automatically generated APIs.
* You get to focus focus on building your solution instead of reinventing the wheel.
