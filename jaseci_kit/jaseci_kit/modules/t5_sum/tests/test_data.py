PAYLOAD = """The US has passed the peak on new coronavirus cases, President Donald
        Trump said and predicted that some states would reopen this month. The US
        has over 637,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 30,826 deaths, the highest
        for any country in the world. At the daily White House coronavirus briefing on
        Wednesday, Trump said new guidelines to reopen the country would be announced
        on Thursday after he speaks to governors. We'll be the comeback kids, all of
        us, he said. We want to get our country back. The Trump administration has
        previously fixed May 1 as a possible date to reopen the world's largest
        economy, but the president said some states may be able to return to normalcy
        earlier than that."""
