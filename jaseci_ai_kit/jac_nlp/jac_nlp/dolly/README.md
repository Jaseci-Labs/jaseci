# **Dolly V2 (`dolly`)**
Databricksâ€™ dolly-v2, an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. Based on pythia-2.8b, Dolly is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine tuning records databricks-dolly-15k generated by Databricks employees in capability domains from the InstructGPT paper, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA and summarization. dolly-v2-3b is not a state-of-the-art model, but does exhibit surprisingly high quality instruction following behavior not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.
