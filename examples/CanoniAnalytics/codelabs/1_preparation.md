# Preparation

Before getting started you have to install Jaseci latest version. Jaseci requeres python 3.10 or later version. We prefer you to create a fresh python environment using conda or any other virtual environment packaging to try out codes in this codelab. A complete Jaseci installation guide is
[here](../../../docs/docs/getting-started/installation.md)

After successfull installation of Jaseci run the help command,

```
jsctl --help

```

`jsctl` stands for the Jaseci Command Line Interface.
If the command above displays the help menu for `jsctl`, then you have successfully installed jaseci.
