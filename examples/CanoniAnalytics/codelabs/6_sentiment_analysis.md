# Analyse sentiments in Dialogues

Sentiment analysis is a process of analyzing text data to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed in it. It involves using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text, such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions. Sentiment analysis is commonly used in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, brand reputation management, and market research. It can help organizations gain insights into customer sentiment, identify emerging trends, and make data-driven decisions. Sentiment analysis can be performed at different levels, including document-level, sentence-level, and aspect-level analysis. The output of sentiment analysis is typically a numerical score or a categorical label that indicates the polarity of the text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
