# Introduction
In this tutorial we will guide you through on how to set up jaseci for actions load local. We will create a simple calculation module and load it locally.

# Step 1 - Build A Custom Jaseci Module: 
We will create a folder name calculator and in the folder create a file name calculator.py.

In the file import jaseci_action module, this will give us power to all jaseci action functionality.

ADD: ``` from jaseci.actions.live_actions import jaseci_action ```

``` 
from jaseci.actions.live_actions import jaseci_action

```

Then, we will proceed to add a function called ```add```. Which will add two numbers.

``` 
from jaseci.actions.live_actions import jaseci_action

@jaseci_action(act_group=["calc"], allow_remote=True)
def add(
    first_number: int, second_number: int
):
answer = first_number + second_number
return answer
```

Lastly, we will create a port (8000) where we will use to launch the server for jaseci action.

```
from jaseci.actions.live_actions import jaseci_action

@jaseci_action(act_group=["calc"], allow_remote=True)
def add(
    first_number: int, second_number: int
):
answer = first_number + second_number
return answer

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from jaseci.actions.remote_actions import launch_server

    launch_server(port=8000)
```

# Step 2 - Load a Custom Jaseci Module:
In this step we will show you how to load this module we created from the jaseci console (jsctl)

The steps are as follows:
* jsctl -m
* actions load local ``PATH_TO_PYTHON_FILE``

After running that it should be loaded to the console.

# Step 3 - Test a Custom Jaseci Module: 
In this step we will test via browser to see if the module you created works.

The steps are as follows:
* In the terminal, cd into the directory where the calculator.py file is
* then run python calculator.py, you should see `` Application startup complete ``
* Go to the browser and type localhost:8000/docs and you should be redirected to fast api frontend application
* click on ``/add/`` 
* click `` try it out ``
* Enter a value for first_number and second_number
* click ``execute``

Now you should see the results. That is the entire process on how to build a custom module, load and test.
