# UOM Jaseci Course Repository

Welcome to the Jaseci course repository by [University of Moratuwa](uom.lk) and [Jaseci](jaseci.org), sponsored by [BCS Technologies](bcstechnologies.com.au).
This repository contains all the necessary materials, documents, and code examples needed for students and lecturers participating in the course. The folder structure is organized by major topics, with each folder containing relevant subfolders and documents.

## Course Outline

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Jaseci, a powerful platform for building AI applications. By following the course structure and participating in hands-on activities, students will be able to quickly get up and running with Jaseci and start building their own AI applications.

### Content

1. **Introduction**
   - Explain what Jaseci is and why it's useful
   - Provide an overview of the architecture and abstractions of Jaseci
2. **Installation**
   - Provide instructions for installing Jaseci on Windows, Mac, and Linux
   - Explain how to set up your editor and install any necessary dependencies (Jac AI Kit and Graphviz)
3. **Interfacing with Jaseci**
   - Describe the three modes of interacting with Jaseci (Local JSCTL mode, remote JSCTL mode, and Jaseci Studios)
   - Explain how to get started with each method
4. **Jaseci Quickstart**
   - Provide a step-by-step guide for writing your first Jaseci application
   - Cover language basics, data types, control flow, input/output, and more
5. **Jaseci AI Kit**
   - Provide an overview of the NLP, speech, and miscellaneous AI features available in the Jaseci AI Kit
   - Explain how to use specific features, such as text summarization, text segmentation, and clustering
6. **Codelabs and Guides**
   - Walk through building a conversational AI system using Jaseci
   - Cover topics like preparing training data, creating custom action modules, and deploying your application
   - Provide additional resources for learning the JAC language and Jaseci AI Kit
7. **Contributing to Jaseci**
   - Explain how to get involved with the Jaseci open-source community and contribute to the project
   - Provide resources for learning how to build custom action modules and extend Jaseci functionality

## Training Methodology + Timeline

| Week  | Content                 | Remarks                                                                       | Student Competency                                       |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st   | Introduction + Installation | Help students and lecturers through the installation process. Give already completed projects and help them run them and get a feel of what Jaseci can do. | Knows how to install Jaseci. Learns how to run JAC code. |
| 2nd - 4th | Jaseci Quickstart       | Quickstart will include a couple of small tutorials so that students can learn basic Jaseci programming incrementally. | Knows basic JAC programming                              |
| 5th | Jaseci AI Kit          | Introduce the Jaseci AI Kit. Explain its features and give a couple of programs to try out. Help students create a JAC program using a new module. | Know how to integrate Jaseci AI Kit                      |
| 6th   | Codelab                 | Walk through the codelab and explain each code line by line in detail. Students will try it on their own time and deliver a demo at the end. | Learns to read the docs and create a production-ready JAC application |
| 7th   | Buffer week for unencountered delays | | |
