# Preparation
Jaseci requires python3.10 or higher as well as a set of common dependencies. If you are on a fresh linux environment, make sure to install the following first:

```
apt-get install python3.10-dev python3-pip git g++ build-essential pkg-config cmake
```

To install jaseci, run this in your development environment:

```
pip install jaseci
```

To test the installation is successful, run:

```
jsctl --help
```

`jsctl` stands for the Jaseci Command Line Interface.
If the command above displays the help menu for `jsctl`, then you have successfully installed jaseci.

> **Note**
>
> Take a look and get familiarized with these commands while you are at it. `jsctl` will be frequently used throughout this journey.
