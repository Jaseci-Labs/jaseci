# Jaseci Webkit
Jaseci Webkit is a library of web components built to integrate (and to make it easy to bootstrap web projects) with a Jaseci API. This library allows you to compose components and build experiences with Jaseci through the use of JSON.

In the future, we will use this library to allow you to craft web experiences directly with the Jac language - the language used to create Jaseci programs.
