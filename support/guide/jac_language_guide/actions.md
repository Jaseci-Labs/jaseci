# Actions in Jaseci

* Actions are computational processing elements. 
* Actions take in a list of context items as input and outputs one or many context items.
* All possible actions are provided by Jaseci. 
* Actions attached to nodes, edges, etc will search walker, itself, then higher dimentional nodes for input contexts in that order.
