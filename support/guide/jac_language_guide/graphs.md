# Graphs

* Graphs are an arrangement of nodes and edges


```jac
graph [name of graph] {
    #this is the root node of the graph
    has anchor [name of anchor];

    #here is where we start to connect nodes with edges creating a graph.
    spawn{
        # declare your nodes in here 

     }
}
```
