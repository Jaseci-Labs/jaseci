Jaseci is a novel computational model invented, designed and implemented to address this challenge.
Jaseci includes a novel programming model we call \emph{data-spacial programming} and a runtime engine we call the \emph{diffuse execution environment} to enable rapid development of large scale and nimble AI applications.
Our initial infrastructure has been used in practice to achieve 10x reduction in development time and near 100\% elimination of typical backend code needed for a complicated AI based application.
Jaseci~\cite{jaseci-website} was open sourced in 2021~\cite{jaseci-github}~\cite{jaseci-pypi}.
Today Jaseci is in production with 4 distinct commercial products built on the engine, including Myca~\cite{myca-website}, HomeLendingPal~\cite{hlp-website},  ZeroShotBot~\cite{zsb-website} and TrueSelph~\cite{ts-website}.
