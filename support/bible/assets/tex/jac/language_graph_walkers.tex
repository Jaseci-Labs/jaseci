    Grammar~\ref{gram:jac.g4:3:16} shows the lines from the formal grammar for Jac that presents the high level structure of a Jac program.

\par
\jacdotnw{jac_connect_chain}{.3}{Graph in memory for JC~\ref{jac:jac_connect_chain.jac}}

Another incredibly useful notion to consider about connect operations is that they can be chained.
The same graph shown in Figure~\ref{dot:jac_connect_chain} can be achieved with the chained usage of the connect operation in line 8 of JC~\ref{jac:jac_connect_chain.jac}. Here nodes are chained in an intuitive left-to-right manor. Relatively sophisticated graph structures can be rapidly expressed using chained connect operations.

\jacdotnw{jac_copy_assign}{.5}{Graph in memory for JC~\ref{jac:jac_copy_assign.jac}}

\subsection{Plucking Values from Node and Edge Sets}

Another very handy dandy feature when interacting with collections of nodes and edges is to quickly extract a list of all the values for a given \lstinline{has} variable across the collection of nodes or edges. Lets look at an example.
\par
\jaccode{jac_arch_plucking.jac}{Plucking values out of nodes and edges}
\par
\shellout{jac_arch_plucking.jac.output}
\par
As shown in JC~\ref{jac:jac_arch_plucking.jac} we are referencing the \lstinline{has} variable of the architypes for the collection of \lstinline{simple} nodes and \lstinline{conn} edges on lines 8 and 9 respectively. As can be seen in the output, these references evaluate to a list of the values for the corresponding variables. Keep in mind this can work with a mixture of nodes and edges in a collection given they share a given \lstinline{has} variable name.

\subsection{Referencing and Dereferencing Nodes and Edges}

Nodes and edges can be referenced and dereferenced.
These operations are synonymous with they way references work in many languages and borrows the syntax of pointers in C/C++.
In particular, the \lstinline{&} is used to get the reference of an object and \lstinline{*} is used to dereference object.
However, in contrast to C/C++, instead of the references representing memory location in word format, references in Jac uses a unique identifier (in UUID format) for the object.
\par
\jaccode{jac_arch_ref_deref.jac}{Rereferences and dereferences in Jac}
\par
\shellout{jac_arch_ref_deref.jac.output}
\par
JC~\ref{jac:jac_arch_ref_deref.jac} shows an example of the behavior of references and dereferences in Jac.
Note that once dereferenced \lstinline{var} is simply a UUID formatted string with the unique identifier of the object itself.
This UUID is equivalent to the \lstinline{jid} in the object \lstinline{.info}.
These referencing and dereferencing operations are quite useful for input and output of node locations to a client side, etc.
\begin{nerd}
    Important Note: The internal representation of an instance of an architype is a string composed of any UUID that starts with \lstinline{"jac:uuid:"}. This may change in the future but, if you were to manually assign such a string to a variable in a Jac program, the program will treat this variable like an object.

\subsection{here and visitor, the `this' references of Jac}
Observe the usage of \texttt{here} and \texttt{visitor} in the \texttt{person} node architype in JC~\ref{jac:jac_local_action.jac}.
These are synonymous to the this reference present in many other languages except \texttt{here} point to the current node scope relevant to the execution point in the program and \texttt{visitor} points to the relevant walker scope relevant to that given point of execution. These references provide full access to all \texttt{has} variables and builtin attributes and operations of the referenced object instance.
\par
Do note that in the context of the \texttt{person} node abilities in JC~\ref{jac:jac_local_action.jac} a here reference to say \texttt{here.name = "joe";} would be equivalent to simply \texttt{name = "joe";} however to capture the \texttt{here.context} (or info/details/etc) the \texttt{here} reference becomes quite useful. The similar relationship applies to using \texttt{visitor} in walker abilities.
