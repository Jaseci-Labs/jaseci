\subsection{Breadth First vs Depth First Walks}

If you've played with the basic \texttt{take} command a bit you would notice that by default it results in a breadth first traversal of a graph.
However, the \texttt{take} command is indeed quite flexible.
You can specify an orientation of the \texttt{take} command to navigate with a breadth first or a depth first traversal.

\par
Take for example the program shown in JC~\ref{jac:jac_walk_bfs.jac}.
First we observe the definition of a static three level binary tree with the graph \texttt{example} on line 3.
This is a vanilla structure as depicted in Figure~\ref{dot:jac_walk_bfs}.
Two walkers are present in this example, one walker \texttt{walk\_with\_breadth}, for which we observe a call to \texttt{take:bfs -->;} indicating a breadth first traversal, and another walker \texttt{walk\_with\_breadth}, for which we observe a call to \texttt{take:bfs -->;} indicating a depth first traversal.
\par
As can be seen in its output,
\par
\shellout{jac_walk_bfs.jac.output}
The print statement on line 34 demonstrate the order of nodes visited correspond to the specified traversal order.
\par
Additionally, the short hand of \texttt{take:b -->;}, or \texttt{take:d -->;} could be used to specify breadth first or depth first traversals respectively.

\section{Yielding Walkers}

So far, we've looked at walkers that will walk the graph carrying state in context (\lstinline{has} variables).
But you may be wonder what happens after its walk? And does it keep that state like nodes and edges? Short answer is no.
At the end of each walk a walker's state is cleared by default while node/edge state persists.
That being said, there are situations where you'd want a walker to keep its state across runs, and perhaps, you may even want a walker to stop during a walk and wait to be explicitly called again updating just a few of it's dynamic state.
This is where the \lstinline{yield} keyword comes in.
\par
The \lstinline{yield} keyword instructs the walker to stop walking and wait to be called again.
There are a number of important semantics of \lstinline{yield}s:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Upon this \lstinline{yield}, a report is returned back and cleared.
    \item Additional report items from further walking will be return on subsequent \lstinline{yield}s or walk completion.
    \item Like the \lstinline{take} command, the entire body of the walker will execute on the current node and actually yield at the end of this execution.
    \item If a start node (aka a `prime' node) is specified when continuing a walker after a \lstinline{yield}, if there are additional walk locations the walker is scheduled to travel to, the walker will ignore this prime node and continue from where it left off on its journey.
    \item If there are no nodes scheduled for the walker to go to next, a prime node must be specified (or the walker will continue from root by default).
    \item \lstinline{with entry} and \lstinline{with exit} code blocks in the walker are not executed upon continuing from a \lstinline{yield} or executing a \lstinline{yeild} respectively. They execute only once starting and ending a walk though there may be many yields in between.
\end{itemize}
