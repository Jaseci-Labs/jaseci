# Archetype

Archetypes are a set of abstractions offered by Jaseci, and Jaseci Studio has a powerful feature that will surprise all programmers. Jaseci Studio allows programmers to view and edit all the code related to a particular archetype, whether it be a node, edge, graph, or walker. This greatly enhances development efficiency. You are allowed to create new archetypes and write the code for them, and register them to the Jaseci application, which is amazing.

## Archetype Viewing

When you click on the Archetype section in Jaseci Studios after logging in, you will notice a section labeled "All Archetypes". Under this section, there are buttons that allow you to view a particular archetype only. Next to each individual archetype, there are buttons to delete and view the code for that archetype. In the archetype list, it will also display the archetype type, name, and a timestamp.

## Editor

The Jaseci Studio editor allows you to edit and write new code for your Jaseci application. This is a great feature, as you will be editing the built version of your code stored in the JIR file, which allows for minor tweaking of the code after deployment. Some instances where you will need to make changes are if your code is outdated and you need features of Jaseci that have updated syntax, APIs being changed, or simply a minor mistake.

## Register Archetype

In the editor, you can create a new archetype, such as a node, edge, graph, or walker, and add it to your Jaseci application. You can write the code in the editor and click the "Register Archetype" button to add it to your Jaseci application.

## Run Walker

A Walker is a key abstraction in Jaseci, and it allows users to interact with the graph of your Jaseci program. The archetype section has a button called "Run Walker." When you click on that button, you will notice a text area that asks for the payload, where you specify the data to be passed to the walker. Next, you have the option to select which node you want to run the walker on. If you select that option, you will have to provide the node JID. Else, the walker will run on the root node by default. After that, you have to select the walker you want to use from the drop-down, which also allows you to search for walkers by name. Finally, after specifying all the parameters, you can click "Run Now," and the walker result will be displayed in the results area. You have the option of copying this result by clicking the clipboard icon.

In summary, Jaseci Studio offers a variety of features, but the archetype section stands out as a unique solution for simplifying programming with Jaseci while enhancing the value of its abstractions.
