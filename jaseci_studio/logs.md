# Logs Viewer

Jaseci Studios provides a Logs Viewer that helps developers to efficiently filter, search, and view logs based on different criteria. Here are some of the key features of the Logs Viewer:

* Filter Logs: With the help of this feature, developers can easily filter logs based on time intervals. This saves developers valuable time that would otherwise be spent manually searching through logs in the built-in Jsserv terminal.

* See Errors Only: It's essential to quickly identify errors while debugging. The Logs Viewer has an "Errors" button that enables developers to view only the error logs, so they don't have to sift through irrelevant data.

* See All the Warnings: Sometimes, Jaseci warns developers about potential issues that may arise by using a specific method. To view these warnings, click on the "Warnings" button in the Logs Viewer.

* See All Info: The Logs Viewer also allows you to view all the information logs generated by your Jsserv instance. To view this information separately, click on the "Info" button.

* Search: If you can't filter logs using the above features, try using the search bar in the Logs Viewer. It helps you find specific logs quickly without wasting time.

These features enhance the Jaseci developer's programming experience and make the overall value of Jaseci more apparent. In the next section, we will cover managing archetypes.
