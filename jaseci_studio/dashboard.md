# Dashboard

After successfully logging in to your Jaseci live instance, you will be directed to the dashboard section in Jaseci Studio. Here, you will find a summary of important information about your Jaseci application. The summary view displays the key abstractions that Jaseci offers, including nodes, edges, graphs, and walkers. This provides you with an idea of how large your application is and the amount of abstractions utilized.

Additionally, the dashboard includes a section titled 'Server Info' which provides detailed information about the version of Jaseci currently running and other important server details.

Next, we will explore the graph view and its unique features in more detail. Let's dive in!
