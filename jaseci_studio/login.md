# Login 

Jaseci Studio login provides an easy way for developers to interact with their Jaseci application, offering a variety of amazing features. Unlike traditional applications that require you to create an account to login, Jaseci Studio allows you to login to any live instance of a Jaseci application worldwide using your super user credentials. It is important to note that you should never share your superuser credentials publicly on GitHub or other platforms.

To login, you must first provide the host where your application or live instance is running, for example, https://localhost, and then input the port where the live instance is running, for example, 9000. Next, enter your superuser email and password. Before clicking "OK," we highly recommend testing your connection to your specified endpoint using the "Test Connection" feature. This ensures that your endpoint is properly connected before attempting to login.

Now you can try to connect to your jaseci live instace, if the connection fails, it may be due to invalid superuser credentials, so please double-check and try again. However, if the connection is successful, you now have access to all the Jaseci Studio features for your application.
