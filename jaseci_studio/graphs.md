# Graph Viewer

Jaseci Studios offers a powerful graph viewer that enables programmers to easily visualise and analyse their code. By providing detailed information about nodes in their Jaseci application graph, this feature enhances the experience of Jaseci hackers and enables quick debugging of code.

Here are some of the amazing capabilities of the graph viewer:

## Node and Edge Information

The graph viewer allows programmers to easily access all the information about a specific node or edge in the graph, including its context, details and info. This provides a comprehensive view of the abstraction, containing the node id, context and other important information.

## Running walker on Node

With the graph viewer, programmers can run a walker on any node in the graph. This facilitates quick debugging of code and testing, which ultimately enhances the coding experience of the programmer utilising Jaseci.

## Node interaction

For large applications with thousands of nodes, navigating the graph can be difficult. The graph viewer allows users to expand single nodes one at a time by double-tapping on the node, which shows the nodes connecting to it, not all the nodes on the graph. Additionally, users can view a single node or a single node and its parent node by unchecking the "expand nodes on click" button at the bottom of Jaseci Studios graph viewer. Furthermore, Jaseci Studios allows users to hide a particular node by clicking the "hide node" button at the bottom right corner of the graph viewer.

## Switch Graph

In Jaseci applications, there may be multiple graphs. Jaseci Studios caters for this by allowing programmers to switch between graphs and leverage all the features of Jaseci Studios.
