# Jaseci Change / Release Notes

## Version 1.4.0.0

### Updates
- Major Design Update: Changed connector operator to `++>` style formating
- Major Feature: Free reference of paths

### Notes
- To update 1.3 code to 1.4 all connection operators needs to go from `-->` style to `++>` style. These include `++>`,`<++`,`<++>`, `+[]+>`,`<+[]+`,`<+[]+>`, etc


## Version 1.3.5-6

### Updates

- Improvement: can now create users more easily through `user create` apis
- New Major Feature: `jsctl` can now run scripts of commands from file
- New Feature: Introduction of `std.round` for rounding floating point valuse, and `std.uniform` for random float values
- Improvement:  `jac test` and `sentinel test` apis have new paramerter `profiling` to enable internal stack profile outputs
- Improvement: `jac test` and `sentinel test` apis have new paramerter `single` to specify a single named test to run

- Major Improvement: Walkers are now proper architypes in stack, all code in architypes
- Improvement: Attributes like anchored and private are not fuzed with anchored objects.
- Improvement: Incompatible/outdated IR now rejected by Jaseci stack

### Notes

- The parameters for `master_create` and `user_create` now take password paramter directly, may need to update calls to those `jaseci.` jac action calls for correct `args` argument.
- Imports updated, imports of style `import {walker*} with...` is now `import {walker::*} with...`
- Walker register and set deprecated. Now architype register and set should be used.
- Deprecated spawn graphs using specail dot syntax (overcomplicates language grammar)

## Version 1.3.4

### Updates

- Improvement: Indicator for being logged in in JSCTL
- New Feature: Email action set
- Major Feature: Async walkers
- Deprecation: Stripe API soft removed.
- Improvement: Improved the deref operator `*` to be more nimble

- Bug Fix: Root nodes now return valid `.type`
- Bug Fix: With exit within walker now executes after exit events in nodes

### Notes

- Behavior change for jac programs utilizing chained connection operators. Connection orders are now intuitive (e.g., `n1 --> n2 --> n3` will create an intuitive chain of connections not `n1 --> n3 <-- n2`)
- API interface update: `sentinel_register` auto_run_ctx replaces ctx to be more specific, `auto_gen_graph` is now `auto_create_graph` for same reason as well
- API interface update: `master_create` API return format updated

### Notes

- Various flags are now args for `jsctl` i.e., `walker run -name init` is now `walker run init` as name is now the standard arg. If you wanted to specify a node the flag would be used as per `walker run init -nd {uuid}`
- Reports back from walker is now dictionary of form `{'report': list(report)}` instead of currnet `list(report)`
- `std.sort_by_col` tweaked to make last paramter a boolean for reverse (instead of string)
- Format of `walker get -mode key` api changed from {key:namespace} to {namespace:key}

- Type, int, float, str, list, dict, bool, are now keywords, if you used these as variable names in legacy code, must make updates.
- The destroy built-in is totally revised `lst.destroy(idx)` on lists should be changed to `destroy lst[idx]`.
- Get_uuid standard library function is deprecated since we have string manipulation
- Internal representation of element now `jac:uuid:` format, should not be visible to coder, `&` references still produce `urn:uuid:` as strings. To dereference use new `*` dereference operators.
