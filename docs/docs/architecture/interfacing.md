# Interfacing the Jaseci Machine

Jaseci offers three distinct modes of interacting with your code - Local, Remote, and Application. Each mode has its own unique benefits, and understanding these modes is crucial to efficient usage of the Jaseci machine.

In this section, we will explore these modes in greater detail and explain the benefits of each.

Notes:
* `sentinel` and `walker run` should be used for remote JSCTL mode and application model.
* `jac run` will **always** run in the local jaseci process of the JSCTL, even if it is logged into a jsserv server.
