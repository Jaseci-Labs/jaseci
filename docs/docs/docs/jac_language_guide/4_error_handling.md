# Error Handling in Jaseci

Error handling is an essential part of software development as it helps developers to identify and resolve issues that might arise during the execution of their code. In Jaseci, error handling is crucial to ensure that our code is robust and reliable.

The error handling section of our documentation covers two main topics: bugs and errors. While the terms "**bugs**" and "**errors**" are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in the context of software development.

A bug is an issue in the code that results in unexpected behavior. It might cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. Bugs can be difficult to identify and fix, and they often require extensive debugging and testing to resolve.

On the other hand, an error is a mistake made by the developer that causes the program to fail. This could be due to syntax errors, missing dependencies, or other issues that prevent the code from executing correctly. Unlike bugs, errors are typically straightforward to fix once identified.

Understanding the difference between bugs and errors is crucial for effective error handling. By categorizing issues correctly, developers can prioritize their efforts and focus on resolving the most critical problems first.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these topics in more detail and provide examples of common bugs and errors that developers might encounter while working with Jaseci.

## Error Handling Examples

In Jaseci, the try-else block is used to handle errors and exceptions in code execution. The else block is a way to execute code only if the try block doesn't raise an exception.

Syntax for try-else block in Jaseci:

```jac
try {
   // code that might have an error or exception
} else {
   // code that will execute if the try block is successful
}
```
Example:

```jac
try {
   x = 1 / 0;
   std.log(x);
} else {
   std.log('The operation was successful');
}
```
In this example, the code inside the try block tries to divide 1 by 0, which will result in a division by zero error. Since there is no catch block in Jaseci, the else block is used to handle the scenario where the try block is successful and the code inside it executes without error. In this case, "The operation was successful" will not be logged, since the try block raised an exception.

The try-else block can also be used to execute different code blocks based on whether the try block is successful or not:

```jac
try {
   // code that might have an error or exception
   std.log('The operation was successful');
} else {
   // code that will execute if the try block raises an exception
   std.log('An error occurred');
}
```

In this example, the code inside the try block logs a message indicating that the operation was successful, while the else block logs a message indicating that an error occurred. This allows for more fine-grained error handling in your code, even without the use of a catch block.
