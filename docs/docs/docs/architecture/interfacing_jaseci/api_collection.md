# Jac API Collections

## APIs for actions

This set action APIs enable the manual management of Jaseci actions and action libraries/sets. Action libraries can be loaded locally into the running instance of the python program, or as a remote container linked action library. In this mode, action libraries operate as micro-services. Jaseci will be able to dynamically and automatically make this decision for the user based on online monitoring and performance profiling.

### Actions Load Local
```
cli: actions load local | api: actions_load_local | auth: admin
file: str (*req)
```
This API will dynamically load a module based on a python file. The module is loaded directly into the running Jaseci python instance. This API also makes an attempt to auto detect and hot load any python package dependencies the file may reference via python's relative imports. This file is assumed to have the necessary annotations and decorations required by Jaseci to recognize its actions.
#### Params
Params file -- The python file with full to load actions from. (i.e., ~/local/myact.py)

### Actions Load Remote
```
cli: actions load remote | api: actions_load_remote | auth: admin
url: str (*req)
```
This API will dynamically load a set of actions that are present on a remote server/micro-service. This server must be configured to interact with Jaseci properly. This is easily achieved using the same decorators used for local action libraries. Remote actions allow for higher flexibility in the languages supported for action libraries. If an library writer would like to use another language, the main hook REST api simply needs to be implemented. Please refer to documentation on creating action libraries for more details.
#### Params
Params url -- The url of the API server supporting Jaseci actions.

### Actions Load Module
```
cli: actions load module | api: actions_load_module | auth: admin
mod: str (*req)
```
This API will dynamically load a module using python's module import format. This is particularly useful for pip installed action libraries as the developer can directly reference the module using the same format as a regular python import. As with load local, the module will be loaded directly into the running Jaseci python instance.
#### Params
Params mod -- The import style module to load actions from. (i.e., jaseci_ai_kit.bi_enc)

### Actions List
```
cli: actions list | api: actions_list | auth: admin
name: str ()
```
This API is used to list the loaded actions active in Jaseci. These actions include all types of loaded actions whether it be local modules or remote containers. A particular set of actions can be viewed using the name parameter.

#### Params
Params name -- The name for a library for which to filter the view of shown actions. If left blank all actions from all loaded sets will be shown.

### Actions Module List

## APIs for architype

The architype set of APIs allow for the addition and removing of architypes. Given a Jac implementation of an architype these APIs are designed for creating, compiling, and managing architypes that can be used by Jaseci. There are two ways to add an architype to Jaseci, either through the management of sentinels using the sentinel API, or by registering independent architypes with these architype APIs. These APIs are also used for inspecting and managing existing arichtypes that a Jaseci instance is aware of.

### Architype Register
```
cli: architype register | api: architype_register | auth: user
code: str (*req), encoded: bool (False), snt: Sentinel (None)
```

This register API allows for the creation or replacement/update of an architype that can then be used by walkers in their interactions of graphs. The code argument takes Jac source code for the single architype. To load multiple architypes and walkers at the same time, use sentinel register API.

#### Params
Params code -- The text (or filename) for an architypes Jac code
encoded -- True/False flag as to whether code is encode in base64
snt -- The UUID of the sentinel to be the owner of this architype

#### Returns
Returns - Fields include 'architype': Architype object if created otherwise null 'success': True/False whether register was successful 'errors': List of errors if register failed 'response': Message on outcome of register call

### Architype Get
```
cli: architype get | api: architype_get | auth: user
arch: Architype (*req), mode: str (default), detailed: bool (False)

```

#### Params
Params arch -- The architype being accessed
mode -- Valid modes: {default, code, ir, }
detailed -- Flag to give summary or complete set of fields

#### Returns
Returns - Fields include (depends on mode) 'code': Formal source code for architype 'ir': Intermediate representation of architype 'architype': Architype object print

### Architype Set

## APIs for sentinel

A sentinel is a unit in Jaseci that represents the organization and management of a collection of architypes and walkers. In a sense, you can think of a sentinel as a complete Jac implementation of a program or API application. Though its the case that many sentinels can be interchangeably across any set of graphs, most use cases will typically be a single sentinel shared by all users and managed by an admin(s), or each users maintaining a single sentinel customized for their individual needs. Many novel usage models are possible, but I'd point the beginner to the model most analogous to typical server side software development to start with. This model would be to have a single admin account responsible for updating a single sentinel that all users would share for their individual graphs. This model is achieved through using \texttt{sentinel_register}, \texttt{sentinel_active_global}, and \texttt{global_sentinel_set}.

### Sentinel Register

## APIs for user

These User APIs enable the creation and management of users on a Jaseci machine. The creation of a user in this context is synonymous to the creation of a master Jaseci object. These APIs are particularly useful when running a Jaseci server or cluster in contrast to running JSCTL on the command line. Upon executing JSCTL a dummy admin user (super_master) is created and all state is dumped to a session file, though any users created during a JSCTL session will indeed be created as part of that session's state.

### User Create
```
cli: user create | api: user_create | auth: public
name: str (*req), password: str (), global_init: str (), global_init_ctx: dict ({}), other_fields: dict ({})
```

This API is used to create users and optionally set them up with a graph and related initialization. In the context of JSCTL, any name is sufficient and no additional information is required. However, for Jaseci serving (whether it be the official Jaseci server, or a custom overloaded server) additional fields are required and should be added to the other fields parameter as per the specifics of the encapsulating server requirements. In the case of the official Jaseci server, the name field must be a valid email, and a password field must be passed through other fields. A number of other optional parameters can also be passed through other feilds. \vspace{3mm}\par This single API call can also be used to fully set up and initialize a user by leveraging the global init parameter. When set, this parameter attaches the user to the global sentinel, creates a new graph for the user, sets it as the active graph, then runs an initialization walker on the root node of this new graph. The initialization walker is identified by the name assigned to global init. The default empty string assigned to global init indicates this global setup should not be run.

#### Params
**Params name** -- The user name to create. For Jaseci server this must be a valid email address.
**global_init** -- The name of an initialization walker. When set the user is linked to the global sentinel and the walker is run on a new active graph created for the user.
**global_init_ctx** -- Context to preload for the initialization walker
**other_fields** -- This parameter is used for additional fields required for overloaded interfaces. This parameter is not used in JSCTL, but is used by Jaseci server for the additional parameters of password, is_activated, and is_superuser.

### User Delete
```
cli: user delete | api: user_delete | auth: admin
name: str (*req)
This API is used to delete a user account.
```
#### Params
**Params name** -- The user name to delete. For Jaseci server this must be a valid email address.

### User Deleteself
```
cli: user deleteself | api: user_deleteself | auth: user
n/a
This API is used to delete a user account.
```
