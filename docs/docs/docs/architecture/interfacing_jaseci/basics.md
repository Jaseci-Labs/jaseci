# The Very Basics: CLI vs Shell-mode, and Session Files

## Shell Mode

In shell mode, all of the same Jaseci API functionality is available within a single session. To invoke shell-mode, simply execute `jsctl` without any commands and `jsctl` will enter shell mode as per the example below. Session Files At this point, itâ€™s important to understand how sessions work. In a nutshell, a session captures the complete state of a jaseci machine. This state includes the status of memory, graphs, walkers, configurations, etc. The complete state of a Jaseci machine can be captured in a .session file. Every time state changes for a given session via the `jsctl` tool the assigned session file is updated. Additionally, jaseci masters have the choice of selecting which session file they want to use with the following command.

```
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# jsctl
Starting Jaseci Shell...
jaseci > graph create
{
"context": {},
"anchor": null,
"name": "root",
"kind": "generic",
"jid": "urn:uuid:ef1eb3e4-91c3-40ba-ae7b-14c496f5ced1",
"j_timestamp": "2021-08-15T15:15:50.903960",
"j_type": "graph"
}
jaseci > exit
haxor@linux:~/jaseci#
```
```
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# jsctl graph create
{
"context": {},
"anchor": null,
"name": "root",
"kind": "generic",
"jid": "urn:uuid:91dd8c79-24e4-4a54-8d48-15bee52c340b",
"j_timestamp": "2021-08-15T15:40:12.163954",
"j_type": "graph"
}
haxor@linux:~/jaseci#
```
```
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# ls *.session
js.session
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# jsctl graph list
[
{
"context": {},
"anchor": null,
"name": "root",
"kind": "generic",
"jid": "urn:uuid:ef1eb3e4-91c3-40ba-ae7b-14c496f5ced1",
"j_timestamp": "2021-08-15T15:55:15.030643",
"j_type": "graph"
},
{
"context": {},
"anchor": null,
"name": "root",
"kind": "generic",
"jid": "urn:uuid:91dd8c79-24e4-4a54-8d48-15bee52c340b",
"j_timestamp": "2021-08-15T15:55:46.419701",
"j_type": "graph"
}
]
haxor@linux:~/jaseci#
```
```
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# jsctl -f mynew.session graph list
[]
haxor@linux:~/jaseci# ls *.session
js.session mynew.session
haxor@linux:~/jaseci#
```

## In-memory mode

It's crucial to keep in mind that there is an in-memory mode that can be activated by using the `-m` or `--mem-only` flags. This option is ideal when you want to experiment with a machine in shell-mode or when you need to run a script in Jac without maintaining machine state after completion. Throughout this chapter, you will see the in-memory session mode being used frequently, giving you a better understanding of its usage.

## CLI Mode

It's crucial to acknowledge that with CLI mode, jaseci administrators have the option to execute commands without retaining a session file or utilizing the in-memory mode.
