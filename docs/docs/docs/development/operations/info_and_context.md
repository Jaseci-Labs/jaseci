# Info and Context

In Jac, you can use the `info` and `context` commands to view the content of a node or edge. Although the following example demonstrates the use of these commands on nodes, the same principles can be applied to edges as well. Take a look at the example below to see how to use the `info` and `context` commands.

**Example:**
```jac
node example{
    has name = "Testing Info and Context commands";
    has result = "Success";
    has favorite_quote = "How you do anything is how you do everything therefore excellence auth to be an habit not an act";
}

walker init{
    example = spawn here node::example;
    context = example.context;
    info = example.info;
    std.out("This is the context result:", context);
    std.out("This is the info result:", info);
}
```

After executing the command above, you will observe that the `context` command displays variables such as name, result, and favorite quote, while the `info` command displays all the information related to the node.
