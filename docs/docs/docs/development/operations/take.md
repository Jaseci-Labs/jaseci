# Take

Jaseci introduces the handy command called "take" to instruct walker to navigate through nodes. You may notice by default, a walker traverse with `take` command using the breadth first search approach (refer to the example [here](../abstractions/walkers.md#walkers-navigating-graphs-example)). But the `take` command is flexible hence you can indicate whether the take command should use a depth first or a breadth first traversal to navigate. Look at the following example;

**Example:**
```jac
node plain: has name;

## defining the graph
graph example {
    has anchor head;
    spawn {
        n=[];
        for i=0 to i<7 by i+=1 {
        n.l::append(spawn node::plain(name=i+1));
        }
        n[0] --> n[1] --> n[2];
        n[1] --> n[3];
        n[0] --> n[4] --> n[5];
        n[4] --> n[6];
        head=n[0];
        }
    }

## walker for breadth first search
walker walk_with_breadth {
    has anchor node_order = [];
    node_order.l::append(here.name);
    take:bfs -->; #can be replaced with take:b -->
    }

walker walk_with_depth {
    has anchor node_order = [];
    node_order.l::append(here.name);
    take:dfs -->; #can be replaced with take:d -->
    }

walker init {
    start = spawn here ++> graph::example;
    b_order = spawn start walker::walk_with_breadth;
    d_order = spawn start walker::walk_with_depth;
    std.out("Walk with Breadth:",b_order,"\nWalk with Depth:",d_order);
    }
```

**Output:**

```
Walk with Breadth: [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7]
Walk with Depth: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

You may see in the above example `take:bfs-->` and `take:dfs --` commands instruct walker to traverse breadth first search or depth first search accordingly. Additionally, to define breadth first or depth first traversals, can use the short hand of `take:b -->` or `take:d —>`.
