Topic Extraction (`topic_ext`)

Module `topic_ext` implemented for producing most relevant and possible set of topics for given set of text documents. Following is an example usage of the `topic_ext` module.

## Actions

* `topic_ext.topic_extraction`: This action extracts top n number of topics from each cluster. The the text along with cluster label for the text cluster should be provided here as an input.
  * Input
    * `texts` - (list of strings) list of input text documents.
    * `labels` - (list of int) list of labels associated with each text documents.
    * `n_topics` - (int) number of topics to extract from each cluster.
  * Returns
    * A dictionary which contains relevant topics for each clusters.

* **Input data file `topic_extraction.json`**
  ```json
  [
    "still waiting card",
    "countries supporting",
    "card still arrived weeks",
    "countries accounts suppor",
    "provide support countries",

    ```

## Example Jac Usage:

```jac
walker init{
    can file.load_json;
    has text = file.load_json("topic_extraction.json");

    can use.encode;
    has encode = use.encode(visitor.text);

    can cluster.get_umap;
    final_features = cluster.get_umap(encode,2);

    can cluster.get_cluster_labels;
    labels = cluster.get_cluster_labels(final_features,"hbdscan",2,2);

    can topic_ext.topic_extraction;
    topic_dict = topic_ext.topic_extraction(texts=text,classes=labels,n_topics=5);
}
```
