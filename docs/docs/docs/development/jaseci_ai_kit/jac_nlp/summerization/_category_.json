        "description": "Summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of creating a shorter, condensed version of a longer piece of text while retaining its key information and meaning. This can be done through various techniques such as extraction, where the most important sentences or phrases are identified and used to create a summary, or abstraction, where the summary is generated by synthesizing new sentences that capture the essence of the original text. Summarization can be applied to a wide range of tasks, such as summarizing news articles, scientific papers, legal documents, or social media posts, and can be used for various purposes, such as aiding in decision-making, information retrieval, or providing quick overviews. Jaseci AI kit contains pre-built SOTA Summerization models that can be utilized immediately without any need for training."
