# Jaseci Primitives

## Node

Can be thought of as the representation of an entity.
- Nodes are composed of context and executable actions.
- Nodes accumulate context via a push function, context can be read as well
- Nodes execute a set of actions upon Entry and Exit.

**Defining a node**
```jac
node [name_of_node] {
}
```


## Edge

- Can be thought of as the relationship between nodes.
- Edges accumulate context via a push function, context can be read as well
- Edges execute a set of actions when traversed.
- For example, person node can have a friend relationship(edge) with another person node

**Defining an edge**

```jac
edge [name_of_edge];
```

## Walker
- Walkers traverse nodes triggering execution at the node level.
- Walkers have the ability to pick up and retain context, which can be taken across nodes.
- Walkers also decide which node to travel through next and records the path of travel (trail) to be recorded within it's own context.
- Walkers can be spawned at any node.
- Walkers can spawn other walkers
- Walkers can carry with them their own actions and contexts that is executed whenever specified in the walkers own code

**Defining a walker**
```jac
 walker [name_of_walker]{
}
```

**Defining specific node code to execute**
When defining a walker, you also write specific code blocks that will only execute when the walker is on a specific node.

```jac
 walker [name_of_walker]{
    [Any code here is executed regardless of the node the walker is on]
    ...
    ...

    person{
     [Any code within this block will only be executed when the walker is on a person node]
   }

   ...

   family{
    [Any code within this block will only be executed when the walker is on a family node]
   }

}
```

### With Entry & With Exit

When defining a walker, you also have the ability to write specific code blocks that execute if and only if a walker enters or exists a node. Any code within the **with_entry** block is the first thing that executes as soon as a walker enter a node. And the opposite is true for **with_exit**, triggering only when the walker is about to leave a node.

```jac
walker [name_of_walker]{
    with entry{
        [code to execute when a walker first enters a node]
    }
    ...
    ...

    with exit{
        [code to execute when a walker is about to leave a node]
    }
}
```
