# Full demo code

## Jac code

Here's the full Jac code for the social network. This is what we'll be referencing and using in the various examples.

`social.jac`

```jac
// person node to represent members of the network
node person {
    has anchor name;
}

// friend edge to describe the relationship between person nodes
edge friend;

walker join {
    has name;

    root {
        report spawn here <--> node::person(name=name);
    }
}

// gets all members of the network
walker get_members {
    has anchor members;

    with entry {
        members = [];
    }

    root {
        take -->;
    }

    person {
        members += [here];
    }
}

// adds a friend to the person node being walked
walker add_friend {
    has new_friend;

    person {
        here <-[friend]-> new_friend;
    }
}

// get the list of friends of the person node being walked
walker get_friend_list {
    has anchor friend_list;

    with entry {
        friend_list = [];
    }

    person {
        friend_list += <-[friend]->;
    }

    with exit {
        for friend in friend_list {
            report friend;
        }
    }
}

// gets suggested friends for the person node being walked
// current algorithm: suggest friends of friends (mutual friends)
walker get_suggested_friends {
    has anchor suggestions;

    with entry {
        suggestions = [];
    }

    person {
        for f in <-[friend]-> {
            for sug in spawn f walker::get_friend_list() {
                if sug != here {
                    suggestions += [sug];
                    report sug;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Demo logic

This is the full version of the demo logic that makes use of the structures define in demo.jac. It acts as a frontend that interacts with your Jac code on the Jaseci engine.
