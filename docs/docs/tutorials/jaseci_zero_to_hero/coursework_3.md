# Day 3 - **Getting Started (Part 2)**


In this Jaseci tutorial video, we will continue our journey to get started with Jaseci by exploring the use of standard (STD) actions and abilities, and diving deep into the workings of walkers. We will also learn how to add more features to our small application using Jaseci, and create a more complex workflow. By the end of this video, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Jaseci to build complex applications with ease.
