# Day 2 - **Getting Started (Part 1)**

In this video, we will be taking the first steps towards using Jaseci, a powerful tool for building complex systems and automating tasks. We'll start by learning about the various tools Jaseci offers to make development easier and how to set them up.

We'll then dive into the core concepts of Jaseci, including graphs, nodes, and edges, and how they work together to create complex workflows. We'll also explore walkers and actions, two key components that allow Jaseci to execute tasks and interact with external systems.

To put our new knowledge into practice, we'll walk through the process of creating a small non-AI application with Jaseci, step by step. By the end of this video, you'll have a solid understanding of Jaseci's capabilities and be ready to start building your own systems and automating tasks with ease.
