# Day 6 - **Building a Jaseci AI Application from Scratch**


In this video, we will learn how to create our own AI module using Jaseci, Python, and Hugging Face API. We will also build a small frontend using Streamlit and connect it with the Jaseci backend to create a complete end-to-end application. You will learn how to leverage the power of Jaseci to build and deploy your own AI models and how to integrate them with your own custom applications.
