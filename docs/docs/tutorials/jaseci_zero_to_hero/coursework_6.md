# Day 6 - **Building a Jaseci AI Application from Scratch**


In this video, we will learn how to create our own AI module using Jaseci, Python, and Hugging Face API. We will also build a small frontend using Streamlit and connect it with the Jaseci backend to create a complete end-to-end application. You will learn how to leverage the power of Jaseci to build and deploy your own AI models and how to integrate them with your own custom applications.

### Final Demo
In this web application, you can enter a web url and the jaseci backend will grab the information from the url and use the AI model to generate a summary of the article. The summary will be displayed on the frontend. and then the summary will be used to generate an image using Huggingface Jaseci API you built. The image will be displayed on the frontend.
