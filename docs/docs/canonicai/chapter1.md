# Build a conversational AI system in Jaseci

# Chapter 1

## What are we building?
We are building a Conversational AI.

### What is a Conversational AI agent?
Conversational AI is a type of artificial intelligence that enables consumers to interact with computer applications the way they would with other humans.

### Real world examples of conversational AI
* Amazon Alexa (Voice)

## What AI will be used
### We will use the following AI capabilities:

### Intent Classification
#### What is Intent Classification?
Intent classification (Text classification) is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It's one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.

### Entity extraction
#### What is Entity extraction?
Entity extraction is a text analysis technique that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically pull out specific data from unstructured text, and classifies it according to predefined categories. Entity extraction, also known as named entity extraction (NER), enables machines to automatically identify or extract entities, like product name, event, and location. Itâ€™s used by search engines to understand queries, chatbots to interact with humans, and teams to automate tedious tasks like data entry.

### Sentence Encoding
#### What is Sentence Encoding?
The Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering, and other natural language tasks. The sentence embeddings can then be trivially used to compute sentence-level meaning similarity as well as to enable better performance on downstream classification tasks using less supervised training data.
