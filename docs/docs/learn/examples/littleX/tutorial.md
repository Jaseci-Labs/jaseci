# **Building an Application with Jaseci**

This guide introduces how the Jaseci Stack accelerates application development by leveraging its graph-based programming model. With Jaseci, we can focus on implementing features rather than setting up complex systems. As you explore Jaseci’s features, you’ll uncover its wide range of use cases. This guide provides a quick introduction, helping you set up the Jaseci framework, define nodes, edges, and walkers, and craft application logic for your project.

## **What We Will Build**

We’ll develop a web application called **LittleX**, a streamlined and efficient version of Elon Musk’s X, using the Jaseci Stack. This project highlights the simplicity and power of Jaseci, enabling us to implement advanced features with minimal code and effort, tasks that typically require considerable time in traditional frameworks.

## **Key Features**
- **User authentication:** Sign up, log in, and profile management.
- **Content management:** Create, view, and interact with posts.
- **Social interactions:** Follow users and explore their content.

With Jaseci, we can focus on building these features seamlessly rather than dealing with the complexities of system setup. This guide focuses on the **backend** for LittleX, showcasing how Jaseci efficiently handles user authentication and database operations.

## Why Jaseci?

Jaseci empowers developers to build smarter applications with less hassle by:

- **Simplifying User Management:** It handles signup, login, and security out of the box.
- **Connecting Data Easily:** Perfect for building apps that need to model relationships, like social networks or recommendation systems.
- **Scalability Built-In:** Designed for cloud performance, so your app grows seamlessly with your users.
- **AI at Your Fingertips:** Adds intelligent features like personalization and moderation with minimal effort.

## **What You Need**

To get started with building **LittleX**, ensure you have the following:

- **About 15 minutes**: Time required to set up and explore the basics.
- **A favorite text editor or IDE**: Any development environment you are comfortable with.
- **Python 3.12 or later**: Ensure that Python 3.12 or higher is installed in your environment.
- **Install required libraries**: Jaclang, Jac-Cloud, MTLLM, and Jac-Splice-Orc.
- **Node.js (optional)**: If you plan to integrate a frontend in future steps.

## **LittleX Architecture**

=== "Single user"
      ![Image title](images/single-user.jpg)
=== "Multiple user"
      ![Image title](images/multi-user.jpg)

LittleX’s graph-based architecture uses nodes for entities like users and posts and edges for relationships like following or reacting. Nodes store attributes and behaviors, while edges capture properties like timestamps. Walkers traverse the graph, enabling dynamic actions and interactions. This design ensures efficient relationship handling, scalability, and extensibility for social media-like features.

## **Getting Started**

### **Set Up Jaseci**
```bash
pip install jaclang jac-cloud mtllm jac-splice-orc
```

### **Lesson 1: Let's create our first Node**

**Jaclang**, language used in Jaseci stack, organizes data as interconnected nodes within a spatial or graph-like structure. It focuses on the **relationships** between data points, rather than processing them **step-by-step**.

**Node**: A node is the fundamental unit of the Jaseci stack. Each node represents an object, entity, or a piece of data.

First create a node with name Person and attributes name, age.
```jac
node Person {
      has name: str;
      has age: int;
}
```

* The `node` keyword defines a node entity in the graph (`Person`).
* The `has` keyword specifies the attributes of the node.
* `name`, `age` are variable names (attributes of the `Person` node).
* `str`, `int` are the corresponding data types of these variables (`str` for string, `int` for integer).

Now, let's create the required nodes for LittleX.

=== "Guide"
      Nodes are essential for representing entities in LittleX. Here are the nodes we need to create:

      - **Profile Node**
        * Represents the user.
        * Fields: username
            ```jac
            node Profile {
                  has username: str = "";
            }
            ```

      - **Tweet Node**
        * Represents an individual tweet.
        * Fields: content, embedding, created_at (timestamp)
            ```jac
            node Tweet {
                  has content: str;
                  has embedding: list;
                  has created_at: str = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");
            }
            ```

      - **Comment Node**
        * Represents comments for the tweets.
        * Fields: content.
            ```jac
            node Comment {
                  has content: str;
            }
            ```

### **Lesson 2: Creating Edges**

**Edge**: Edge represents the connections or relationships between nodes. Edges can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
![Image title](images/Family.jpg)

First, create an edge named Relation with the attribute 'since'.
```jac
edge Relation {
      has since: int;
}
```

* The `edge` keyword defines a relationship between nodes (Relation).
* The `has` keyword specifies the attributes of the edge.
* `int` is used for integer values (years).
* `str` is used for string values (names).

Now, let's create the required edges for LittleX.

=== "Guide"
      Edges define the relationships between nodes. Here are the edges we need to create:

      - **Follows Edge**
        * Represents the relationship between users who follow each other.
            ```jac
            edge Follow {}
            ```

      - **Like Edge**
        * Represents the interactions between users and the tweets.
            ```jac
            edge Like {}
            ```

      - **Post Edge**
        * Represents the relationship between the tweets and its authors.
            ```jac
            edge Post {}
            ```

### **Lesson 3: Creating our first Walker**
Walkers are graph-traversing agents in Jaclang that perform tasks without requiring initialization and can define abilities for various node types. The Jaseci stack automatically converts walkers into RESTful API endpoints.

First, create a walker named Relation with the attribute 'since'.
```jac
walker Agent {
      has name: str;
}
```
Now Lets create required walkers for LittleX.

=== "Guide"
      Walkers are graph-traversing agents that perform tasks. Here are the walkers we need to create:

      - **User Initialization Walker**

        * **Implement User Initialization Walker**
            * Creates or visits a new profile node for a user.
            * Ensures profiles exist in the system for any user action.
                  ```jac
                  walker visit_profile {
                        can visit_profile with `root entry {
                              visit [-->(`?Profile)] else {
                                    new_profile = here ++> Profile();
                                    visit new_profile;
                              }
                        }
                  }
                  ```
            * If current walker enter via `root`, `visit_profile` ability will be executed.
            * `visit [-->(``?profile)] else {}` Checks whether profile node exist from root, if yes, visit to that profile node. Otherwise execute to else part.
            * `here ++> profile()` It creates a profile node and connects with current node(`root`).
            * `visit new_profile` Walker visit to that node (`profile`).

        * **Test User Initialization Walker**

            * To test the `visit_profile` function, we begin by spawning the `visit_profile` walker on the root node. Next, we filter the nodes connected to the root to identify any profile nodes. Finally, we verify whether the connected node is indeed a profile node.
            ```Jac
            test visit_profile {
                  root spawn visit_profile();
                  profile = [root --> (`?Profile)][0];
                  check isinstance(profile,Profile);
            }
            ```
            * spawn visit_profile walker on root node: ``root spawn visit_walker();``
            * filter profile node: ``profile = [root --> (`?Profile)][0];``
            * check is this node Profile or not : ``check isinstance(profile,Profile);``

      - **Load User Profile Walker**
        * **Implement Load User Profile Walker**
            * Loads all profiles from the database.
            * Useful for managing or listing all users in the system.
                  ```jac
                  walker load_user_profiles {
                        obj __specs__ {
                              static has auth: bool = False;
                        }
                        can load_profiles with `root entry {
                              self.profiles: list = [];

                              for user in NodeAnchor.Collection.find({"name": "profile"}) {
                                    user_node = user.architype;
                                    self.profiles.append(
                                    {"name": user_node.username, "id": jid(user_node)}
                                    );
                              }
                              report self.profiles;
                        }
                  }
                  ```
            * `static has auth: bool = False` Set disable authentication for that walker.
            * `NodeAnchor.Collection.find({"name": "profile"})` Get list of profiles.
            * `user.architype` Get architype of user node.
            * `jid(user_node)` Get the unique id of an object.

      - **Update Profile Walker**
        * **Implement Update Profile Walker**
            * Updates a user's profile, specifically the username.
                  ```jac
                  walker update_profile :visit_profile: {
                        has new_username: str;
                  }
                  ```
            * First `visit_profile` walker is called and it visits to `Profile` node.
            * `here.username = self.new_username` Update username.
            * How `update_profile` walker spawned on `Profile` node, update the name will be discussed later.

        * **Test Update Profile Walker**

            * To test this functionality, the `update_profile` walker should be spawned from the `root` node. After execution, the connected `Profile` node can be retrieved and verified to ensure that the username has been correctly updated.

            ```Jac
            test update_profile {
                  root spawn update_profile( new_username = "test_user" );
                  profile = [root --> (`?Profile)][0];
                  check profile.username == "test_user";
            }
            ```

            * spawn update_profile walker on root: ``root spawn update_profile();``
            * filter profile node : ``profile = [root --> (`?Profile)][0];``
            * check updated username : ``check profile.username == "test_user";``

      - **Get Profile Walker**
        * **Implement Get Profile Walker**
            * Retrieves profile details and logs them.
                  ```jac
                  walker get_profile :visit_profile: {
                  }
                  ```
            * First `visit_profile` walker is called and it visits to `Profile` node.
            * How `get_profile` walker spawned on `Profile` node, get the profile detailes will be discussed later.

      - **Follow Request Walker**
        * **Implement Follow Request Walker**
            * Creates a follow edge.
                  ```jac
                  walker follow_request {}
                  ```
            * Walker `follow_request`, when spawned on the followee profile, will create a Follow edge from the follower to the followee.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Follow Request Walker**

            * To test `follow_request`, we have to create new profile and it named "Sam," is created to serve as the followee. After executing the walker, the test proceeds by navigating from the followee to confirm the presence of a Follow edge, which indicates the successful creation of the follow request. Finally, the test verifies that the username of the connected profile matches the expected followee.
            ```Jac
            test follow_request {
                  followee = Profile("Sam");
                  followee spawn follow_request();
                  followee_profile = [root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)][0];
                  check followee_profile.username == "Sam";
            }
            ```
            * create followee profile : ``followee = Profile("Sam");``.
            * spawn follow_request walker on profile_node : ``followee spawn follow_request();``.
            * filter followee profile : ``followee_profile = [root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)][0];``.
            * check followee profile username : ``check followee_profile.username == "Sam";``.

      - **Unfollow Request Walker**
        * **Implement Unfollow Request Walker**
            * Removes the follow edge.
                  ```jac
                  walker un_follow_request {}
                  ```
            * Walker `un_follow_request` spawned on followee profile will remove the `Follow` edge from follower to followee.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Unfollow Request Walker**

            * To test the `unfollow_request` walker, a new profile named "Sam" is first created to act as the followee. A follow relationship is initially established between the root profile and "Sam" using the `follow_request` walker. Then, the `unfollow_request` walker is executed to initiate the unfollow action.

            * After executing the walker, the test proceeds by navigating from the root profile to verify the removal of the `Follow` edge. The absence of this edge confirms that the unfollow request was successfully processed. Finally, the test ensures that no connection exists between the root profile and the profile previously followed.

            ```Jac
            test un_follow_request {
                  followee = [root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)][0];
                  followee spawn un_follow_request();
                  check len([root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)]) == 0;
            }
            ```

            * filter profile node : ``followee = [root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)][0];``
            * spawn un_follow_request walker on profile_node : ``followee spawn un_follow_request();``
            * check length of the profiles that connect within Follow edge : ```check len([root --> (`?Profile)->:Follow:->(`?Profile)]) == 0;```

      - **Create Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Create Tweet Walker**
            * Creates a new tweet for a profile and adds it to the graph using a `Post` edge.
                  ```jac
                  walker create_tweet :visit_profile: {
                        has content: str;

                        can tweet with profile entry {
                              embedding = sentence_transformer.encode(self.content).tolist();
                              tweet_node = here +>:Post:+> Tweet(content=self.content, embedding=embedding);
                              report tweet_node;
                        }
                  }
                  ```
            * `embedding = sentence_transformer.encode(self.content).tolist()` Embedding the content.
            * `tweet_node = here +>:post:+> tweet(content=self.content, embedding=embedding)+` Create a new tweet with content, its embedding.
            * `report tweet_node` reports the newly created tweet node.

        * **Test Create Tweet Walker**

            * To perform `create_tweet` test, the `create tweet` walker is spawned on the root node. The test then checks whether there are any `tweet` nodes connected to the `profile` node. Finally, it validates that the tweet has been correctly created and linked as expected.

            ```Jac
            test create_tweet {
                  root spawn create_tweet( content = "test_tweet" );
                  test1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];
                  check test1.content == "test_tweet";
            }
            ```

            * spawn create_tweet walker on root: `root spawn create_tweet();`
            * filter tweet node : ``test1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];``
            * check tweet is correctly created : `check test1.content == "test_tweet";`

      - **Update Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Update Tweet Walker**
            * Updates the content of an existing tweet by its ID.
                  ```jac
                  walker update_tweet {
                        has updated_content: str;
                  }
                  ```
            * Walker `update_tweet` spawned on tweet node, that will update the content of the tweet.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Update Tweet Walker**

            * To test the `update_tweet`,first we have to filter is there any `tweet` nodes connected with `profile`node. Then `update_tweet` walker spawn on the `tweet_node`. Finally, the test checks whether the tweet's content has been correctly updated.
            ```Jac
            test update_tweet {
                  tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];
                  tweet1 spawn update_tweet( updated_content = "new_tweet" );
                  check tweet1.content == "new_tweet";
            }
            ```
            * filter is there any tweets : ``tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];``
            * spawn update_tweet walker on tweet_node : `tweet1 spawn update_tweet();`
            * check tweet is updated : `check tweet1.content == "new_tweet";`

      - **Remove Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Remove Tweet Walker**
            * Deletes a tweet by removing its connection to the profile.
                  ```jac
                  walker remove_tweet {}
                  ```
            * Walker `remove_tweet`, when spawned on a tweet node, will remove the tweet.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Remove Tweet Walker**

            * To test the `remove_tweet` walker, we have to check is there any tweets connected with `profile` node.Then we can spawn `remove_tweet` walker on the `tweet_node`. Finally, the test verifies that the tweet node has been successfully removed and is no longer connected to the profile.
            ```Jac
            test remove_tweet {
                  tweet2 =  [root --> (`?Profile)--> (`?Tweet)][0];
                  tweet2 spawn remove_tweet();
                  check len([root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)]) == 0;
            }
            ```
            * checks is there any tweets : ``tweet2 =  [root --> (`?Profile)--> (`?Tweet)][0];``
            * spawn remove_tweet walker on tweet_node : `tweet2 spawn remove_tweet();`
            * check tweet is removed : ``check len([root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)]) == 0;``

      - **Like Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Like Tweet Walker**
            * Adds a like edge between a tweet and the profile liking it.
                  ```jac
                  walker like_tweet {}
                  ```
            * Walker `like_tweet` spawned on tweet node, that will like the tweet.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Like Tweet Walker**

            * To test `Like_tweet`,we have to start by creating a tweet from the `root` node and then navigates to the corresponding `tweet` node. The process continues by spawning the `like_tweet` walker from the `tweet1` node. Finally, it confirms that the username `"test_user"` is correctly associated with the `Like` relationship on the tweet.
            ```Jac
            test like_tweet {
                  root spawn create_tweet( content = "test_like");
                  tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];
                  tweet1 spawn like_tweet();
                  test1 = [tweet1 ->:Like:-> ][0];
                  check test1.username == "test_user";
            }
            ```
            * spawn like_walker walker on tweet_node : `root spawn create_tweet(0);`
            * filter is there any tweets : ``tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];``
            * spawn walker : `tweet1 spawn like_tweet();`
            * filter is like to tweet : `test1 = [tweet1 ->:Like:-> ][0];`
            * check liked profile username : ` check test1.username == "test_user";`

      - **Remove Like Walker**
        * **Implement Remove Like Walker**
            * Removes the like edge
                  ```jac
                  walker remove_like {}
                  ```
            * Walker `remove_like` spawned on tweet node, that will remove the like.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Remove Like Walker**

            * To test `remove_like`, we have to retrieves an existing tweet; if the tweet exists, it proceeds to visit the tweet node. Then, it spawns the `remove_like` walker from the `tweet` node. The function subsequently checks whether the `Like` relationship has been successfully removed by confirming that the length of the associated likes is zero.
            ```Jac
            test remove_like {
                  tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];
                  tweet1 spawn remove_like();
                  check len([tweet1 ->:Like:-> ]) == 0;
            }
            ```
            * check is there any liked tweets : ``tweet1 = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)][0];``
            * spawn remove_like walker on tweet_node : `tweet1 spawn remove_like();`
            * check like is removed : `check len([tweet1 ->:Like:-> ]) == 0;`

      - **Comment Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Comment Tweet Walker**
            * Adds a comment to a tweet by creating a comment node and connecting it to the tweet.
                  ```jac
                  walker comment_tweet {
                        has content: str;
                  }
                  ```
            * Walker `comment_tweet` spawned on tweet node, that will add a comment to tweet and create a edge with author of the comment.
            * How it is executed will be discussed later.

        * **Test Comment Tweet Walker**

            * To test `comment_tweet` ,we have to begin with checking whether there is any tweet with content similar to `'test_like'`. If such a tweet exists, it proceeds to visit it. To test the `comment_tweet` functionality, the function spawns a `comment_tweet` node on the `tweet` node and filters the `comment` node connected to the tweet. Finally, it verifies whether the content of the comment matches the expected value, confirming that the comment was successfully added to the tweet.
            ```Jac
            test comment_tweet {
                  tweet = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)](?content == "test_like")[0];
                  tweet spawn comment_tweet(
                        content = "test_comment",
                  );
                  comment = [tweet --> (`?Comment)][0];
                  check comment.content == "test_comment";
            }
            ```
            * filter tweet's content : ``tweet = [root --> (`?Profile) --> (`?Tweet)](?content == "test_like")[0];``
            * spawn comment_tweet walker on tweet_node : `tweet spawn comment_tweet();`
            * filter commnet : ``comment = [tweet --> (`?Comment)][0];``
            * check comment correctly added or not : `check comment.content == "test_comment";`

      - **Load Tweet Walker**
        * **Implement Load Tweet Walker**
            * Loads detailed information about a tweet, including its content, embedding and author.
                  ```jac
                  walker load_tweet:visit_profile: {
                        has if_report: bool = False;
                        has tweet_info: list[TweetInfo] = [];

                        can go_to_tweet with Profile entry {
                              visit [-->(`?Tweet)];
                              if self.if_report {
                                    report self.tweet_info;
                              }
                        }
                  }
                  ```
            * First `visit_profile` walker is called and it visits to `Profile` node.
            * `visit [-->(`?Tweet)]` visits to each tweet and retrieve the info of tweets posted by the user.
            * How those tweets are retrieved will be discussed later.

      - **Load Feed Walker**
        * **Implement Load Feed Walker**
            * Fetches all tweets for a profile, including their comments and likes.

                        has search_query: str = "";

                        can load with Profile entry {
                              feeds: list = [];
                              user_tweets = here spawn load_tweets();
                              feeds.extend(user_tweets.tweet_info);

                              for user_node in [->:Follow:->](`?Profile) {
                                    user_tweets = user_node spawn load_tweets();
                                    feeds.extend(user_tweets.tweet_info);
                              }

### **Lesson 4: Let's add some AI magic to our application using the power of MTLLM:**

In this lesson, we'll explore how to leverage AI to enhance your application. MTLLM supports easy integration of multiple LLM models, and for this tutorial, we are using Llama. If you need more details on integrating different models, please check the [MTLLM documentation](../../for_coders/jac-mtllm/quickstart.md). (You can also explore OpenAI’s LittleX for additional insights.)
Using Llama, you can summarize tweets to quickly understand trends, major events, and notable interactions in just one line.

**Why This Feature Matters**

Think of your application as a personalized newsfeed or trend analyzer.

- **Save Time:** Instead of scrolling through dozens of tweets, users get a quick summary of what's happening.
- **Gain Insights:** By distilling key information, the application helps users make sense of large volumes of data.
- **Engage Users:** AI-powered summaries make the experience dynamic and intelligent, setting your platform apart from others.

=== "Guide"
      - **Import Lamma with MTLLM**
      ```jac
      import from mtllm.llms {Ollama}
      glob llm = Ollama(host="http://127.0.0.1:11434", model_name="llama3.2:1b");
      ```
      - **Summarize Tweets Using Lamma:**
        * Summarize the latest trends, events, and interactions in tweets
            ```jac
            can 'Summarize latest trends, major events, and notable interactions from the recent tweets in one line.'
                  summarise_tweets(tweets: list[str]) -> 'Summarisation': str by llm();
            ```
      - **Test with Swagger**
       * Run the above mtllm example with `jac serve mtllm_example.jac`.
       * Register with email and password.
       * Login with registered email and password.
       * Copy the authentication key and paste it in authentication box.
       * Run the get_summary api endpoint.

### **Lesson 5: Exploring Graph Security**

Up until this point, you’ve successfully created a single-user social media application where a user can post tweets, like them, and interact with comments.

Now, imagine scaling this application to handle multiple users. Questions arise, such as:

- How do you ensure users cannot modify or view others' data without permission?
- How do you securely enable collaboration, such as liking or commenting on someone else's tweet?

This is where graph security in Jaclang simplifies managing access and permissions between users' graphs.

Jaclang offers explicit access control, ensuring data privacy and secure interactions between user graphs. Permissions define what other users can do with specific parts of a graph.

**Access Levels**

- **`NO_ACCESS`:** No access to the current archetype.
- **`READ`:** Read-only access to the current archetype.
- **`CONNECT`:** Allows other users' nodes to connect to the current node.
- **`WRITE`:** Full access, including modification of the current archetype.

**Granting and Managing Access**

By default, users cannot access other users' nodes. To grant access, permission mapping must be added explicitly.

- **Grant Access Using Walkers**
      ```jac
      Jac.allow_root(here, NodeAnchor.ref(self.root_ref_jid), self.access);
      ```
- **Remove Access**
      ```jac
      Jac.disallow_root(here, NodeAnchor.ref(self.root_ref_jid));
      ```
- **Grant Read Access to All**
      ```jac
      Jac.perm_grant(here, "READ");
      ```
- **perm_revoke Access**
      ```jac
      Jac.perm_revoke(here);
      ```

=== "Guide"
      **Scenarios**

      - Posting a Tweet (Granting Read Access)

        * When a user creates a tweet, it is private by default.
        * To make it viewable by others, the system explicitly grants READ access to the tweet.
        * **Create Tweet Walker**
                  ```jac
                  walker create_tweet :visit_profile: {
                        has content: str;

                        can tweet with Profile entry {
                              embedding = sentence_transformer.encode(self.content).tolist();
                              tweet_node = here +>:Post:+> Tweet(content=self.content, embedding=embedding);
                              Jac.perm_grant(tweet_node[0], level="CONNECT");
                              report tweet_node;
                        }
                  }
                  ```
        * `Jac.perm_grant(here, level="READ")` perm_grant that tweet node to everyone with read access.

      - Commenting on a Tweet

        * Similar to liking, commenting requires CONNECT access.
        * A new comment node is created and linked to the tweet while granting READ access for others to view it.
        * **Comment Tweet Ability**
                  ```jac
                  can comment with comment_tweet entry {
                        current_profile = [root-->(`?Profile)];
                        comment_node = current_profile[0] ++> Comment(content=here.content);
                        Jac.perm_grant(comment_node[0], level="CONNECT");
                        self ++> comment_node[0];
                        report comment_node[0];
                  }
                  ```
        * `Jac.perm_grant(tweet_node, level="CONNECT")` perm_grant the tweet node to connect level.

    ```

### **Lesson 6: Adding node abilities**
Nodes in Jaclang can have abilities defined to perform specific tasks. These abilities are structured as entry and exit points.

Imagine a smart home system where each room is represented as a node. Walkers traverse these nodes, performing tasks like turning lights on or off, adjusting temperature, or sending alerts when entering or exiting a room.

**Entry**
When someone enters a room:

- **Lights Turn On:** The system detects entry and automatically switches on the lights to ensure the person feels welcomed.
- **Room Occupied:** The system marks the room as occupied in its database or tracking system.

You enter the Living Room, and the system turns on the lights and logs your presence.

**Exit**
When someone exits a room:

- **Lights Turn Off:** The system detects the exit and switches off the lights to save energy.
- **Room Vacant:** It marks the room as unoccupied in its tracking system.

You leave the Living Room, and the system turns off the lights and updates its records to show the room is vacant.

=== "Guide"
      **Scenarios in node**

      - Update profile

        * A user updates their profile.
        * **Update Tweet Walker Ability**
                  ```jac

                        has updated_content: str;

                        can visit_tweet with profile entry {
                              tweet_node = &self.tweet_id;
                              visit tweet_node;
                        }

                        can update_tweet with tweet entry {
                              here.content = self.updated_content;
                              report here;
                        }
                  }
                  ```
        * **Update Profile Node Ability**

            * It replaces the abilities in walker.
                  ```jac
                  can update with update_profile entry {

                  }
                  ```
        * As `update_profile` walker is spawned on `Profile`, it visits to `Profile`.
        *  With the entry of the `update_profile` walker, Profile will be updated.

      - Get profile

        * Get profile details.
        * **Update Tweet Walker Ability**
                  ```jac
                  walker get_profile :visit_profile: {
                        can get_profile with profile entry {
                              report here;
                        }
                  }
                  ```
        * **Create get ability**

            * It replaces the abilities in walker.
                  ```jac
                  can get with get_profile entry {
                        report self;
                  }
                  ```
        * As `get_profile` walker is spawned on `Profile`, It visits to `Profile`.
        *  With the entry of the `get_profile` walker, Profile will be reported.

      - Follow profile

        * Following a user.
        * **Update Tweet Walker Ability**
                  ```jac
                  walker follow_request :visit_profile: {
                        has profile_id: str;

                  ```jac
                  can follow with follow_request entry {
                        current_profile = [root-->(`?Profile)];
                        current_profile[0] +>:Follow():+> self;
                        report self;
                  }
                  ```
        * As `follow_request` walker is spawned on `Profile`, it visits to `Profile`.
        *  With the entry of the `follow_request` walker, `Follow` edge is created and connected.
        * `[root-->(`?Profile)]` gets the current user profile.
        * `current_profile[0] +>:Follow():+> self` connects the followee with Follow edge.

      - Unfollow profile

        * Unfollowing a user.
