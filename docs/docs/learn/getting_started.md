# Installation

Firstly make sure that Python 3.12 or higher is installed in your environment, then simply install Jac using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install -U jaclang
```

Once you've got Jaclang installed, just give the Jac CLI a try to make sure everything's up and running smoothly.

- Start the Jac CLI:
    ```bash
    jac --version
    ```
- Run a .jac fil
    ```bash
    jac run <file_name>.jac
- To test run a 'Hello World'Program
    ```bash
    echo "with entry { print('hello world'); }" > test.jac;
    jac run test.jac;
    rm test.jac;
    ```
> **Note**
>
> If these commands prints ```hello world``` you are good to go.
