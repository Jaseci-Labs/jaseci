Jac is an innovative programming language that extends Python's semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem. It introduces cutting-edge programming models and abstractions specifically designed to minimize and hide complexity, embrace AI-forward development, and automate categories of common software systems that typically require manual implementation. Despite being relatively new, Jac has already proven its production-grade capabilities, currently powering several real-world applications across various use cases.

Jaseci serves as the implementation of the Jac runtime, functioning in a relationship similar to how CPython serves as the reference implementation for Python. This runtime environment enables Jac code to execute with its enhanced features while maintaining the seamless Python interoperability that makes the language particularly accessible to Python developers.

- <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Jac supersets Python</span>

    ---

    *Jac is a drop-in replacement for Python and supersets Python, much like Typescript supersets Javascript or C++ supersets C.*

- <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Novel Code Construct for AI</span>

    ---

    *Jac introduces a new way programmers can integrate LLMs into their code. Simply replace a function body with an llm call, need for prompt engineering, learning extensive libraries and complicated new syntaxes.*



- <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Beyond OOP with Data Spatial Programming</span>

    ---

    *Jac introduces super OOP constructs for a new paradigmn called data spatial OOP, enhancing the handling and visualization of data in ways traditional programming paradigms might not support.*

- <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">Cloud Native Abstractions</span>

    ---

     *Jac makes persistence and user concepts part of the language, enabling simple programs to run unchanged in terminals or across clouds. Jac streamlines development by removing the need for dev ops and cloud setup.*

<!-- # Welcome to Jac

**Jac** combines the power and flexibility of Python's ecosystem and 'pythonic' coding style with a unique 'jactastic' approach to programming. It draws inspiration from a variety of programming languages to improve upon Python to create an engaging, productive, and intuitive coding experience, giving the coder all of python's power, plus superpowers. Additionally, Jac introduces a keystone innovation that may prove to be a monumental advancement in programming languages called the **Data Spatial Programming Model**.

Just as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brought a higher level of abstraction to C and Fortran's functions offered a new way to manage assembly code, Jac introduces Data Spatial Programming constructs expanding on the concept of OOP. This new model is a higher-level abstraction that lets programmers rethink how they interact with data structures, and enable new ways of thinking and being productive.

That being said, Jac was meticulously designed to provide a seamless gradient of expressiveness allowing coders to code in a familiar pythonic style, while using as much or as little data spatial semantics as they'd like.

## A Love Letter to Python, and Beyond

Jac's design encapsulates a love for the world of programming, computers, and code. It captures the spirit of what makes coding joyful while expanding upon the foundation laid by the beloved language - Python. At its core, Jac is a love letter to Python and modern coding. It inherits the clean syntax, flexibility, and broad applicability that makes Python one of the most popular programming languages in the world while being designed to give us coders new (and old) superpowers.

## A New Home Language

The goal of Jac is to serve as a home language for a coders lifestyle. Jac is built for us, folks who love python, see coding as beauty, and are serious hackers aiming to launch everything they do to the world. It is the language that I've always wanted and one that I believe you will enjoy too. We are looking forward to seeing what you will create with Jac, and how you will add to its evolving story.

Join us on this exciting journey. Let's make code art with Jac. -->
