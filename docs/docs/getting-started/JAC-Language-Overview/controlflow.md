## Select Statement 
```jac
# simple If statement
walker init {
    x = 3.56;
    y = "X is not equal to 3.45";

    if (x ==3.45) {
        std.out(x);
    }
    elif (x==3.56){
        std.out("it's a match");
    }
     else {
        std.out(y);
    }
}

```
Other Conditional statements like < , > ,!= , "and" and "or" are also supported.

## For and While loop

Loops are written similiar to python it run a specific amount of time as in the case of the "For" loop or until a condition is meet as in the case for the "While" loop.

```jac
walker init {
    # the for loop
    for i=0 to i<10 by i+=1:
        std.out(i)

    #the while loop
    while(x<10){
        std.out(x);
        x = x +1;
    }
}
```
