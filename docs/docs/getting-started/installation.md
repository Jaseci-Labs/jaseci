### Software Requirements

To run commands for Jaseci we need a terminal that accepts bash arguments. We recommend using the Ubuntu terminal that comes as the default with WSL.

1. Check if WSL is installed by running the following the Windows powershell terminal :

 ```python
 wsl -l -v
 ```
 This will return  the flavour of the distribution used for WSL. The version column will show the version of WSL.

2. If no version is specified open windows powershell in  adminstrator mode and install WSL by running :
    ```
    wsl --install
    ````

3. Restart your Computer

4.Open the Ubuntu terminal. for more information on installation see [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
