# Test Drive

Let's test out the JAC language by running a simple programs which utilizes control structures and output statments.

```jac

walker init {
    x = 34 -30;
    y = "Hello";
    z = 3.45;

```
Jaseci uses a uique paradigm based around graphs, to traverse these graphs we use an component called Walker.Think of the walker as a little robot friend who traverses the nodes and edges of graphs. Variables are initialize by equating it to a value.

```jac
walker init {
    x = 34 -30;
    y = "Hello";
    z = 3.45;


if(z==3.45 or y=="Bye"){
    x =x+1;
    y=y+" World" ;

}
```

The  IF statment is very similiar to those of python. Conditions such as AND , OR and = can be used within the brackets of the IF statment.
Note that after every line there is a semicolon .

```jac
walker init {
    x = 34 -30;
    y = "Hello";
    z = 3.45;


if(z==3.45 or y=="Bye"){
    x =x+1;
    y=y+" World" ;
}

std.out(x);
```
std.out() prints any variable passed in to the function on to the terminal.

```jac
walker init {
    x = 34 -30;
    y = "Hello";
    z = 3.45;


if(z==3.45 or y=="Bye"){
    x =x+1;
    y=y+" World" ;
}

std.out(x);
for i=0 to i<3 by i+=1:
    std.out(x-1,'-',y);

report [x,y+'s'];
}
```

This FOR loop will run 3 times. Printing the values of (x -1) and the value of y. The report list adds data to the payload.The Payload is returned and printed at the end of the program.

Let's run the program by  opening the terminal and running:
```
 jsctl jac run class2.jac

 ```

 Your Output should look like this:
