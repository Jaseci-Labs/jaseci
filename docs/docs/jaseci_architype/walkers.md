# Walkers

Welcome to this section where we will explore one of the key features of Jaseci: Walkers. Walkers are analogous to little robots that can traverse the graph of your Jaseci application and perform various operations along the way.

In this lesson, we will provide a detailed explanation of walkers, including the take, yield, ignore, and destroy commands that can be used to control their behavior. We will also discuss the technical semantics of walkers and how they can be used to spawn other walkers within the graph. Additionally, we will cover the various types of walks that are available in Jaseci.

By mastering the concepts and techniques covered in this section, you will be able to create more sophisticated and powerful applications in Jaseci. So, let's dive in and explore the exciting world of walkers and their capabilities.
