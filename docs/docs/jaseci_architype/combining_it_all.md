# Combining it All

Congratulations, you have successfully completed this section and gained a wealth of knowledge about Jaseci. Now, it's time to put your new skills to the test and apply what you've learned in a practical setting.

We invite you to experiment with the code provided below in our code labs, where you can combine all the concepts and abstractions you've learned in this section. Take some time to analyze the code, and try to understand how the different abstractions in Jaseci are utilized to accomplish specific tasks.

By practicing with the code, you will gain a deeper understanding of the Jaseci programming language and build confidence in your ability to develop more advanced applications. So, go ahead and dive into the code labs, and see how far your newfound knowledge can take you.
