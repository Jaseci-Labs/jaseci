# Edges

Welcome to this section where we will explore one of the fundamental abstractions in Jaseci: Edges. As a developer, understanding how to connect different nodes using edges is essential for building sophisticated applications with Jaseci.

In this lesson, we will provide a detailed explanation of edges, including the syntax of the connect operator and how to extract values from nodes. Additionally, we will discuss the different types of edges available in Jaseci and how to use them effectively in your applications.

By mastering the concepts and techniques covered in this section, you will be able to create complex, interconnected systems in Jaseci. So, let's begin our exploration of edges and discover how they can help you build more powerful applications.
