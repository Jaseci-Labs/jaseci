# Understanding Contexts in Jaseci Programs

In Jaseci programming, two scopes are visible at every execution point: the walker's scope and the node's scope. These scopes can be referenced using the special variables **`here`** and **`visitor`**, respectively. The walker uses **here** to refer to the context of the node it is currently executing on, while abilities use **visitor** to refer to the context of the current walker executing.

For example, let's say we have a Jaseci program that defines a **person** node with attributes such as **name**, **age**, and **profession**. We also have a walker that iterates over all "person" nodes in the graph and prints out their names. We can access the **name** attribute of each node using the **here** context, like so:

```jac
node person {
    has name, age, profession;
}
edge society{
    has location;
}

graph  people_in_society{
    has anchor community;
    spawn{
        professions = ["lawyer", "doctor", "teacher", "athlete", "entrepreneur"];
        community = spawn node::person(name = rand.word(), age = rand.integer(34, 56), profession = rand.choice(professions));
        for i in professions{
            spawn community +[society]+> node::person(name = rand.word(), age = rand.integer(34, 56), profession = rand.choice(professions));
        }
    }
}
walker print_names {
    community = -[society]->;
    for persons in community{
        take -[society]->;
        std.out(here.name);
    }
}
 walker init{
    spawn here ++> graph::people_in_society;
    spawn here walker::print_names;
    root{
        take-->[0];
    }
 }
```
