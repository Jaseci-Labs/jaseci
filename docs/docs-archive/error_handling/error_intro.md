# Handling Errors in Jaseci

Error handling is an essential part of software development as it helps developers to identify and resolve issues that might arise during the execution of their code. In our coding language, Jaseci, error handling is crucial to ensure that our code is robust and reliable.

The error handling section of our documentation covers two main topics: bugs and errors. While the terms "**bugs**" and "**errors**" are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in the context of software development.

A bug is an issue in the code that results in unexpected behavior. It might cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. Bugs can be difficult to identify and fix, and they often require extensive debugging and testing to resolve.

On the other hand, an error is a mistake made by the developer that causes the program to fail. This could be due to syntax errors, missing dependencies, or other issues that prevent the code from executing correctly. Unlike bugs, errors are typically straightforward to fix once identified.

Understanding the difference between bugs and errors is crucial for effective error handling. By categorizing issues correctly, developers can prioritize their efforts and focus on resolving the most critical problems first.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these topics in more detail and provide examples of common bugs and errors that developers might encounter while working with Jaseci.
