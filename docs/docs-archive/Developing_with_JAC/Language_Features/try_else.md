# Error Handling with try-else Blocks in Jaseci

In Jaseci, the try-else block is used to handle errors and exceptions in code execution. The else block is a way to execute code only if the try block doesn't raise an exception.

Syntax for try-else block in Jaseci:

```jac
try {
   // code that might have an error or exception
} else {
   // code that will execute if the try block is successful
}
```
Example:

```jac
try {
   x = 1 / 0;
   std.log(x);
} else {
   std.log('The operation was successful');
}
```
In this example, the code inside the try block tries to divide 1 by 0, which will result in a division by zero error. Since there is no catch block in Jaseci, the else block is used to handle the scenario where the try block is successful and the code inside it executes without error. In this case, "The operation was successful" will not be logged, since the try block raised an exception.

The try-else block can also be used to execute different code blocks based on whether the try block is successful or not:

```jac
try {
   // code that might have an error or exception
   std.log('The operation was successful');
} else {
   // code that will execute if the try block raises an exception
   std.log('An error occurred');
}
```

In this example, the code inside the try block logs a message indicating that the operation was successful, while the else block logs a message indicating that an error occurred. This allows for more fine-grained error handling in your code, even without the use of a catch block.
