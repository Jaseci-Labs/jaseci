Welcome to the Jaseci installation guide! We are excited that you have decided to explore the world of Jaseci, and we are here to assist you in the installation process.

Jaseci offers a range of packages that can enhance the production of bleeding edge AI, including the Jaseci NLP library, Jaseci Speech library, Jaseci Miscellaneous library, and JAC Vision. Additionally, the Jaseci VS Code Extension provides syntax highlighting and auto-complete features, while Jaseci Studio allows Jaseci hackers to develop programs and visualize the graph output seamlessly. Furthermore, Jaseci Studio includes features that enable you to test and develop JAC programs, which we will cover in later sections.
