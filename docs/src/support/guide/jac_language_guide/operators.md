# Operators

## Arthimetic 

```jac
# addition
a = 4 + 4;
e = a + b + c + d;

# multiplication
b = 4 * -5;

# division
c = 4 / 4;  # Returns a floating point number

# subtraction
d = 4 - 6;

# exponent / power
a = 4 ^ 4;

# modulus
b = 9 % 5

```
## Equality
```jac
# equal
a == b

# not equal
a != b

# less than
a < b

# greater than
a > b

# less than and equal to
a <= b

# greater than and equal to
a >= b
```

## Logical
```jac
# not
!a,

# and
a && b
a and b

# or
a || b
a or b

# mixture
!a or b
!(a and b)
```
## Assigments
```jac
a = 4 + 4;
a += 4 + 4;
a -= 4 * -5;
a *= 4 / 4;
a /= 4 - 6;
```
