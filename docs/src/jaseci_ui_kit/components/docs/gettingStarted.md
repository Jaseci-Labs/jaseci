# Jaseci Studio

## Overview
Jaseci Studio is being built to be a full-featured IDE for Jaseci where developers can manage development projects, rapidly build user interfaces with our WYSIWYG editor as well as code up and deploy your JAC apps with full integration and support. For now, Jaseci Studio allows you to easily weild our very own Jaseci Webkit language via a WYSIWYG editor or directly via an editor. 

Our Jaseci Webkit language is a JSON-based representation of a variety of UI components, events and states which render as web-based user interfaces capable of consuming the Jaseci API. With our Jaseci UI Kit library, you can author Jaseci Webkit components right in your JAC code! That's right, we've also made it so that you can write front-end and back-end code within a single codebase!
