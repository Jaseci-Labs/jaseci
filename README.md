# Jaseci Ecosystem

Welcome to the Jaseci project. This repository houses the core libraries and tooling for building
agentic AI applications with the Jac programming language.

The project brings together a set of components that work seamlessly together:

- **[`jaclang`](jac/):** The Jac programming language, a dropâ€‘in replacement for and superset of Python.
- **[`jac-cloud`](jac-cloud/):** Cloudâ€‘native utilities that automatically turn a Jac application into a production-ready server stack.
- **[`jac VSCE`](jac/support/vscode_ext):** The official VSÂ Code extension for Jac.
- **[`mtllm`](jac-mtllm/):** Easy integration of large language models into your applications.

## Quick Start

Install the language and tools directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install jaclang jac-cloud mtllm
```

After installation run `jac --help` to explore the available commands.

## Documentation

Comprehensive guides and API references are available at the [official documentation site][Documentation].
