# Jaseci: Build the Next Generation of AI Products at Scale

The [Jaseci](https://www.jaseci.org/) ecosystem, is an open-source technology stack composed of three components: 
**Jaseci Core**, the fundamental execution engine, 
**Jaseci Serv**, a cloud-scale runtime engine with diffuse capabilities, 
and **Jaseci AI Kit**, a collection of state-of-the-art AI engines and pre-trained models contributed by the Jaseci team and the open source community. Additionally, **Jaseci Studio**, is a comprehensive IDE for programming and debugging Jaseci programs.

Jaseci presents a groundbreaking computational model that aims to simplify the process of developing AI applications. Through its exclusive data-spacial programming approach and diffuse execution environment, Jaseci has accomplished remarkable feats, such as decreasing development time by tenfold and almost completely removing standard backend code. Jaseci is invented by professors and researchers from the University of Michigan and has been open-source since 2021. Jaseci has been used by dozens of developers to create commercial products in various domains serving tens of thousands requests per day.

# Getting Started

To install Jaseci and all its packages, refer to the comprehensive Jaseci [Installation Guide](https://docs.jaseci.org/docs/docs/getting_started/installation).

For a quick start, install the `jaseci` python package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install jaseci
```

To set up a Jaseci server, please follow the steps outlined in the [Jaseci Server Setup guide](https://docs.jaseci.org/docs/docs/getting_started/setup_jaseci_serv).
To set up Jaseci Studio, please follow the instructions outlined in the [following guide](https://docs.jaseci.org/docs/docs/getting_started/setting_up_jaseci_studio).

A quick hello world example:
```jac
walker init{
  std.out("Hello World");
}
```

To run this example, save the code in a file named `main.jac` file and run with `jac run` command in `jsctl` shell;

```bash
jsctl
```
This will execute the Jaseci command line environment `jsctl`.

```bash
jaseci> jac run hello.jac
```
